## SGI Performer Archives

This is an archive of SGI Performer binaries and source.  As far as I can tell, the only source released for Performer was for the demos and utility libraries.

Currently, this archive only contains SGI Performer 3.0 for Windows. IRIX and Linux may be added later.

SGI ported Performer to Windows and Linux and called it "open source". But it wasn't really, and they admitted as much at [oss.sgi.com/projects/performer](https://web.archive.org/web/20010515070700/http://oss.sgi.com/projects/performer/):

>***Is OpenGL Performer Open Source?***
>
>*Technically, no. Only the OpenGL Performer samples and utility libraries are included here. Also, our license does not conform to clause 8 of the Open Source Definition.*

Intriguingly, the Performer 3.0 for Windows install *does* include debug libs and PDBs for the core Performer library.  So it may be possible to recover the source via Ghidra and AI, enabling Performer to live on forever.
