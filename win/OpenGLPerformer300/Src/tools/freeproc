# freeproc - shell script for un-restricting and un-isolating processors
#
# This script is useful for freeing up processors if a program
#	that isolates or restricts processors exits ungracefully.
# The example program 
#		/usr/share/Performer/src/pguide/libpf/progs/procestup.c
#	shows how to isolate and restrict processors for specific
#	processes.
#
# This script must be run as root to work.
#
