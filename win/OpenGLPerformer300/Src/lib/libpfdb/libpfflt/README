This README concerns loaders for Flight and OpenFlight (TM) databases.

/usr/share/Performer/lib/libpfflt.a is a loader for Flight Version 13 
databases.  It is used by /usr/share/Performer/bin/perfly.

Software Systems very recently released an OpenFlight (TM) Version 14
loader.  This loader can be found in /usr/share/Performer/lib/libpfflt14.a.
A perfly executable using Version 14 can be found in
/usr/share/Performer/bin/perfly.flt14.

The two libraries libpfflt.a and libpfflt14.a can be used
interchangeably when linking applications.  In each case, LoadFlt() is
the routine which loads a database.  The sample Makefiles link with
the Flight Version 13 loader.  This can be changed by adding a line
to the top of the makefile:

	FLTVER=14

or by specifying this on the make command line, e.g:

	make FLTVER=14 dbg

To request more information about these loaders, contact Software
Systems at (408) 247-4326.  The files README.V13 and README.V14
provided by Software Systems describe the Version 13 and 14 loaders.

A loader for Version 11 Flight format is included in libpfsgi.  Source
code can be found in /usr/share/Performer/src/libpfsgi.
