Source code for the Designers Workbench loader/writer for Performer.

The loader will take a designers workbench file and load that into a Performer
application. The writer will take a performer application and write that out
in Designers Workbench format (Dwb).

The same loader can be compiled with the CC flags:

    -D__ESCENE__ -DLINKLOADER

This will give you pfdwb.o that can be used to re-link EasyScene thus 
integrating your changes and bugfixes into EasyScene. EasyScene uses a
special DWB loader to support EasyScene specific features. Make sure
this new .o is before the EasyScene library on you link line.

This is also supplied with every release of Performer under the following
directory:

	/usr/share/Performer/src/lib/libpfdb/libpfdwb
