<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       <B>simplify</B> - Interactive OpenGL Performer tool for simplify-
       ing geometry.  a simplification of a complex  object  that
       contains the original object.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Program  <B>simplify</B>  is  an interactive tool that is used to
       simplify a complex object.  It  has  two  main  functions.
       First,  it  can  create  a  regular  simplification of the
       object, in which the constraints are  that  the  resulting
       geometry  does not cross the inner and outer boundary at a
       certain distance from the original surface. In  this  case
       all vertex parameters, such us the normal or texture coor-
       dinates, are preserved. Simplified version of  the  object
       can  be used to create an pfLOD node (see the man page for
       pfLOD).

       Second, the program <B>simplify</B> can  create  a  proxy  of  an
       object.  A proxy is a simplified version of the object and
       it has a property that the original object is fully inside
       the  proxy.   This property is important because the proxy
       is used in image based rendering where  the  images  of  a
       complex objects from various directions are projected onto
       the proxy. This way it is possible to render a  very  com-
       plex object using a simplified version (a proxy) and store
       the surface detail, including the associated lighting,  in
       multiple  textures.   See the man page for <B>makeProxyImages</B>
       to get more information about the process  of  making  the
       textures that are projected on the proxy.

       The  program <B>simplify</B> is based on perfly and it shares all
       its command line parameters and key commands (see man page
       for  perfly).  When executing the program <B>simplify</B> you can
       specify the perfly-like  command  line  parameters  first,
       then  you  enter  the  file name of the object you want to
       simplify and the output file name. Optionally you can  add
       additional command line parameters specific to the simpli-
       fication algorithm.  You can get the list of those parame-
       ters by running simplify with no option or option -h.

       When you start the program <B>simplify</B> the menu is similar to
       the one of perfly. There is an additional pane of  buttons
       and sliders, called simplify pane, that can be enabled and
       disabled using the <B>Simplify</B> <B>pane</B> button. The first  button
       of  the simplify pane controls whether to select the algo-
       rithm for making proxy (the default) or the regular object
       simplification algorithm.


       <B>MAKING</B> <B>PROXY</B> <B>OF</B> <B>AN</B> <B>OBJECT</B>

       The  algorithm  for  computing  the  proxy  has two steps.

       There  are two possible ways of creatin the outer boundary
       and the initial proxy. By default, a marching cubes  algo-
       rithm  is  used  to create an isosurface at a certain dis-
       tance from the original object. The  isosurface  is  later
       moved  to the distance of the outer boundary (slider <B>Outer</B>
       <B>boundary</B>) and a copy of the isosurface  is  moved  to  the
       distance  of  the initial proxy (slider <B>Initial</B> <B>distance</B>).
       The distances are specified as a percentage of the  object
       diameter  (more  precisely,  the  diameter of the object's
       bounding sphere).

       The marching cubes algorithm has the  following  controls.
       In  the  menu  it is possible to set the grid size at each
       axis and the distance of the isosurface  from  the  object
       (slider  <B>Iso</B> <B>distance</B>).  The finer the grid the longer the
       algorithm takes and the more complex the initial proxy is.
       On  the  other  hand,  too  coarse grid may result in many
       details being missed.  Note that even  when  the  marching
       cubes  algorithm is not applied the grid is used to accel-
       erate the intersection test of the simplified  proxy  with
       the  boundary surfaces thus it is not recomended to reduce
       the grid resolution too much.

       In general, the algorithm does not work very well  if  the
       desired  isosurface  distance is too small compared to the
       size of a grid voxel.  That is why it is possible to spec-
       ify  the  isosurface  distance  separately  from the outer
       boundary distance and the initial proxy distance. Often it
       is  possible  to  specify  the  isosurface  distance large
       enough that the isosurface does not miss any part  of  the
       object  and then move it closer as needed. It is also pos-
       sible to preview the isosurface  by  pressing  button  <B>Get</B>
       <B>isosurface</B>.  Note  that the button <B>Show</B> <B>boundary</B> has to be
       depressed.

       When button <B>Do</B> <B>marching</B> <B>cubes</B> is not  pressed,  the  outer
       boundary  and  the initial proxy are created by displacing
       the original surface  along  its  normals.  This  approach
       works  better in case the distances are very small. Unfor-
       tunately, some areas of the object may not be  simplified.
       For  example, if two parts of the object are touching dis-
       placing along the normals will create a  self-intersecting
       boundary  that  will not allow any room for simplification
       in the area of intersection.

       After pressing the button <B>Run</B> <B>simplify</B> <B>proxy</B> the simplifi-
       cation  algorithm  starts  by moving the isosurface or the
       original surface to create the outer boundary and the ini-
       tial  proxy.   The initial proxy is simplified by removing
       vertices and edges as long as the surface  is  within  the
       surfaces defined by the object and the outer boundary.  At
       the end the vertices of the proxy are moved  as  close  to
       the original object as possible and the resulting proxy is
       stored in a file.

       The simplification algorithm  can  be  stopped  or  paused
       using  <B>Stop</B>  <B>simplify</B>  or <B>Pause</B> button, respectively. When
       the algorithm is paused it is possible to output the  cur-
       very similar to the controls for the algorithm for  making
       proxy.   The algorithm is using two boundary surfaces, the
       outer boundary and the inner  boundary.  If  the  marching
       cubes  algorithm  is  selected  the  distance  of the both
       boundaries from the original surface is the same (in abso-
       lute  value)  and  it is controlled by the slider <B>Iso</B> <B>dis-</B>
       <B>tance</B>.  Similarly as in the case of  making  a  proxy  the
       isosuface can be previewed by pressing the button <B>Get</B> <B>iso-</B>
       <B>surface</B>.  If the <B>Do</B> <B>marching</B> <B>cubes</B> button is  not  pressed
       the  boundaries are created by moving the original surface
       along its normals to distances specified  by  the  sliders
       <B>Outer</B>  <B>boundary</B> and <B>Inner</B> <B>boundary</B>. Note that the distance
       for the inner boundary is specified as a negative  number.

       The  algorithm  is started by pressing the button <B>Run</B> <B>sim-</B>
       <B>plify</B>.  The computation can be paused or stopped using the
       <B>Pause</B> or <B>Stop</B> <B>implify</B> button, respectively. When the algo-
       rithm is paused it is possible to  save  the  intermediate
       result  by  pressing the button <B>Save</B> <B>mesh</B> or to toggle the
       visibility of the boundary by  pressing  the  button  <B>Show</B>
       <B>boundary</B>.  After  the  simplification  is finished you can
       display the original object by pressing the button <B>Restore</B>
       <B>object</B>.   You  can restart the algorithm without restoring
       the original object.

       As you may realize this algorithm could be used to  create
       an  object  proxy  if  the marching cubes algorithm is not
       used and the inner distance is set to zero. The result may
       be  different,  though, because the algorithm is trying to
       preserve   seams   between   pfGeoSets   with    different
       pfGeoStates, which is not necessary for the proxy.
