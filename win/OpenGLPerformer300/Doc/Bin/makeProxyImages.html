<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       <B>makeProxyImages</B>  -  OpenGL  Performer  tool for generating
       images for image-based rendering in which the  images  are
       projected on a proxy, a simplified version of the object

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  program  <B>makeProxyImages</B>  is one of the tool programs
       distributed with  the  OpenGL  Performer  high-performance
       graphics library.  It can be used to create images (views)
       of the specified object from a set  of  directions.  Since
       the  images  are being projected on a proxy, a simplifica-
       tion of the original object, additional processing may  be
       required  to add views of parts of the proxy that are par-
       tially or fully obstructed by  other  parts.  These  addi-
       tional  texture  pieces are important because as the proxy
       is rotated away from the view at  which  the  texture  was
       computed  some  parts  of the proxy that were not directly
       visible from the view may become visible. Thus each  image
       consists  of  the  view  of the object and a collection of
       texture pieces for obstructed parts of the  proxy.  It  is
       necessary to store texture coordinates for each proxy tri-
       angle so that the texture  pieces  are  correctly  mapped.
       Consequently, the program <B>makeProxyImages</B> outputs not only
       textures storing the views but also a pfIBRnode that  con-
       tains  the texture coordinates and the proxy geometry. The
       proxy of an  object  can  be  created  using  the  program
       <B>simplify</B>.

       The input to the program is the file containg the original
       complex object.  The file containing the proxy  is  speci-
       fied  using the switch -pf, the images are stored in files
       with the name specified using the switch -f (a view number
       and  the  extension  rgb  is added automatically), and the
       resulting pfIBRnode is stored in a  file  specified  using
       the switch -pfb.

       It  is  also  important to specify the size of the texture
       (-W xsize ysize) and the oversampling factor in  case  the
       hardware  does  not  support antialiasing (switch -o). The
       view directions can be defined using the  text  file  with
       information  about  rings  (switch  -rv), using only views
       around the object (switch -n),  or  using  uniformly  dis-
       tributed  3D  views  (switch  -nv).  Each line of the ring
       file contains two values: the angle  from  the  horizontal
       plane  and how many views are created for that angle.  Use
       the switch -sk if you want to skip  a  certain  number  of
       views in each ring.

       By  default  the program uses orthographic projection. The
       center of the projection is the  center  of  the  bounding
       sphere  around the object and the object is scaled so that
       the bounding sphere fits  the  window.   If  the  bounding
       textures thus it is important you specify the  lights  the
       same  way as in your scene.  By default the default perfly
       lighting is selected. You  can  specify  your  own  lights
       using  the  switch -l (-l posx posy posz posw r g b). Sev-
       eral switches can be used to define multiple lights.


       <B>PACKING</B> <B>ADDITIONAL</B> <B>TEXTURE</B> <B>PIECES</B>

       By default the program <B>makeProxyImages</B>  renders  only  the
       view  of  the object, without the extra texture pieces for
       obstructed triangles of the proxy. To enable this  feature
       you  have  to  add  the  switch  -ev.  The process has two
       steps. First, the number and size  of  texture  pieces  is
       determined  and a packing algorithm determines their posi-
       tion around the primary view. Second, for  each  view  the
       texture pieces are rendered in place.

       The  packing  algorithm  operates on pixel level and there
       are several switches that effect its speed and quality  of
       results.   To speed up the packing algorithm you can down-
       sample the textures before packing using the switch  -evd.
       The  drawback  is  that  there  may  be  more wasted space
       between texture pieces.  You can also reduce the number of
       neighboring pixels the algorithm checks when finding opti-
       mal place for texture pieces (switch -evp).   In  general,
       the  texture pieces are not aligned with their neighboring
       pieces, thus when the view texture is mipmapped  the  gaps
       between  the textures may become visible. For this purpose
       you can add the switch -evmp and set how  many  mipmapping
       levels  will  be without any cracks.  What happens is that
       each edge of the texture piece that is  not  a  silhouette
       edge  is  extended to contain more pixels from neighboring
       triangles.  Setting the value too high may cause the pack-
       ing algorithm to fail.

       If the packing algorithm fails to place the texture pieces
       around the primary view the object is scaled down a little
       (for  the given view) and the algorithm is restarted. This
       repeats until all texture pieces fit.

       Similarly as obstructed triangles may come into full  view
       also  backfacing  triangle may become visible as the proxy
       is rotated away from the view.  Thus it is possible to add
       texture pieces for backfacing triangles into the view tex-
       ture using the switch -bf. Not  all  backfacing  triangles
       are  added  but only those that may be visible from neigh-
       boring views.  Since additional texture  pieces  that  are
       used for backfacing triangles of the proxy can be found in
       neighboring views it is advantageous  to  combine  several
       views  into  a  single texture. This reduces the number of
       texture pieces packed into a texture for one view. You can
       use  the switch -tm to control this. It is recommended not
       to exceed 2K x 2K when combining several  views  into  one
       texture.


       <B>FINETUNING</B> <B>TEXTURE</B> <B>RENDERING</B>

       triangles may be  transparent.   This  may  cause  visible
       cracks when the object is rotated.  Moving the clip planes
       reduces some of the cracks.

       If you move the plane that is behind the triangle  further
       away  (switch  -evlb)  some of the geometry that is behind
       the silhouette is included in the texture.  When you  move
       the  front clip plane closer to the cameras (switch -evlf)
       some of the geometry that is in front of the silhouette is
       included in the texture.

       Since some proxy triangles may have texture with transpar-
       ent edges it may be desirable to sort the proxy triangles.
       Since  the  proxy  can  be viewed from any direction it is
       necessary to determine how the triangles are  sorted.   If
       the proxy is rendered with selecting only the nearest view
       the triangles are ordered for each view  differently.  You
       have  to  set  that mode using the switch -nr. By default,
       three or four nearest views are blended together.  In that
       case  the  proxy  triangles  are  sorted for each group of
       views.  Sometimes it may be possible  to  see  changes  in
       transparency  as the view moves from one group of views to
       another. If this becomes too obvious you can  disable  the
       sorting using the switch -evns.

       All  the  issues  mentioned in this section can be drasti-
       cally reduced if the proxy is very close to  the  original
       object - especially around visible sharp edges - or if the
       number of views is increased.

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       To obtain the full set of command  line  options  run  the
       program <B>makeProxyImages</B> without any parameters.


       If  your machine does not support a single-buffered visual
       with at least 8 bits per red, green, blue, and alpha  com-
       ponent  the  images  may be missing alpha channel. See the
       number of alpha bits  printed  at  the  beginning  of  the
       <B>makeProxyImages</B>  output.   On some SGI systems with multi-
       sampling you may try to use the switch -nms to  request  a
       visual  wihout multisampling, improving the chance of get-
       ting a visual with alpha channel.

       Do not forget to oversample the textures on machines  with
       no antialiasing (switch -o).

       The  process  may take very long time if the proxy is very
       fine and many texture pieces have  to  be  added  to  each
       view.  Since the rendering is done into a window make sure
       that you do not overlap the window during the  process  or
       that the screen saver does not start.  If some of the tex-
       tures are corrupt you may restart the  program  with  same
       parameters and add the switch -sfr that skips rendering of
       the given number of textures. It is also a  good  idea  to
       increase  shared  arena size (using environmental variable
       PFSHAREDSIZE) to avoid memory overflow when the  pfIBRnode
       is saved at the end.
