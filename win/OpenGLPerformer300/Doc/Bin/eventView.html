<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       This page describes tools for adding and viewing real-time
       events in a Performer program. In describes the  following
       programs:

              <B>evpp</B> -
                   An  Event  Pre-Processor. This program takes a
                   description of user events and generates  a  C
                   program adding the new events into an applica-
                   tion programs.

              <B>evanalyzer</B> -
                   A viewing program for captured events.

              <B>evhist</B> -
                   A display program for generating histograms of
                   event durations. Usually activated from within
                   <B>evanalyzer</B>.

              <B>evgraph</B> -
                   A display program for  plotting  functions  of
                   event information slots.

              <B>evmerge</B> -
                   A utility program for merging event files.



   <B>evpp</B> <B>-</B> <B>Event</B> <B>Pre-Processor.</B>
       <B>evpp</B>  is  a  pre-processor  for  adding  user-events to an
       OpenGL Performer program. It takes an text file describing
       a  set of new event types. It produces a C source file and
       a C include file. Compiling and linking the new  C  source
       file in your program enables recording the newly generated
       events.

       Here's an example of an <B>evpp</B> input file:


       file "out.timefile";

       malloc "pfSharedMalloc";

       group "my_APP"     0x000001;
       group "my_Cull_CB" 0x000002;

       group "my_APP"
               {
               event "my_pfFrame";
               event "my_pfSync";
               };

       group "my_Cull_CB"
               {
                       event "my_Cull_Group_CB"
                               {
                                       size 5;
                               };

                       event "my_Cull_DCS_CB"
                               {
                                       size 5;
                               };
               };

       event "myCB"
               {
                       info "myInfo"
                       {
                               type int;
                               name "myInfoName";
                       };
               }



       The above file defines two groups of events. Each group
       contains two events.  In the second group (my_Cull_CB),
       each event is an array of five events. This is useful for
       generating the same event types from different processes.
       In this case, each CULL process will generate events on
       callbacks to pfGroups and pfDCS.  The above file also
       defines an event called <I>myCB</I> which doesn't belong to any
       group. This event contains a single information slot of
       type integer on it.

       The <I>file</I> directive specifies the output file name. If the
       character <B>?</B>  is used instead of a file name, the generated
       macros <B>EVENT_WRITE</B> and <B>EVENT_WRITE_ALL</B> will require a file
       name as a parameter.

       The <I>max</I><B>_</B><I>events</I> directive specifies the maximum number of
       events that will be allocated and captured.

       The <I>c</I><B>_</B><I>file</I> and <I>h</I><B>_</B><I>file</I> directives specify the file names
       for the source code files that <B>evpp</B> generates.

       The <I>active</I> directive may be <I>true</I> or <I>false</I>. It determines
       whether <B>evpp</B> will generate empty macros. This is useful
       The <I>malloc</I> directive allows defining an alternative memory
       allocation for internal eventView use. If using anything
       other than "pfSharedMalloc" as the <I>malloc</I> value, the
       application must supply a function receiving an int and
       returning a void* pointer to newly allocated memory.
       pfSharedMalloc is a built in function that allocates mem-
       ory off the Performer shared arena.

       When defining a group of events, one must first define a
       group mask. The <I>group</I> directive accept a group name and a
       mask. Masks may overlap. This is useful for defining hier-
       archies of groups.

       An <I>event</I> directive is used for defining single events.
       They may be inside or outside the definition of a group.
       And event should have a name, and may have a size and
       information slots. In the example above, an event of size
       5 is effectively an array of five independent events. This
       is useful for creating per-pipe events.



   <B>evpp</B> <B>command</B> <B>line</B> <B>options</B>
              -h   Print usage string.

              -c   Compile generated files. This option can make
                   Makefiles simpler.

              -n   Set all the events in the input file to inac-
                   tive. The macros generated for all events will
                   be empty. This flag use useful when trying to
                   disable the instrumentation of a source file
                   without removing the macros.



   <B>evanalyzer</B> <B>-</B> <B>a</B> <B>graphic</B> <B>event</B> <B>display</B> <B>program.</B>
       <B>evanalyzer</B> generates a graphic display of captures events.
       Each line in its display contains events of a single type.
       The horizontal axis of the display denotes the time.

       An event starts at a vertical bar from the bottom of the
       event line to its middle, continues horizontally and ends
       as a vertical bar from the middle of the event line to its
       top.


       <B>evanalyzer</B> <B>keyboard/mouse</B> <B>controls</B>

              Up/Down arrows -
                   Change the zoom factor of the display.

              Right/Left arrows -
                   Shift display window across the captured data.

              Left Mouse Button -
                   Pick an event start/end. Clicking on one event
                   start/end and releasing on another, prints the
                   time difference between the two on the top of
                   If the mouse is on an event line and the event
                   has information fields, allow toggling their
                   display.  If the mouse is not on an event
                   line, toggle events displayed or groups dis-
                   played.

              <B>h</B> key -
                   Bring up a histogram program (<B>evhist</B>) and run
                   it on the currently selected event.

              <B>f</B> key -
                   If the event line under the mouse has informa-
                   tion slots, ask to pick a slot.  Bring up a
                   function plot program (<B>evgraph</B>) and run it on
                   the selected information slot on the current
                   event.  <B>ESC</B> - Exits <B>evanalyzer</B>.


       <B>evhist</B> <B>keyboard</B> <B>controls.</B>

       Moving the mouse across the window prints how many samples
       are on the histogram bar under the mouse and what time
       value it represents.


              Up/Down arrows -
                   Change the resolution of the histogram.

              Right/Left arrows -
                   Change the percentage of samples on both
                   extremes of the histogram that we ignore (Dis-
                   played as <I>garbage</I> on the top of the display).

              <B>ESC</B> -
                   Exits <B>evhist</B>.


   <B>evgraph</B> <B>-</B> <B>plot</B> <B>event</B> <B>info.</B>
       <B>evgraph</B> is a display program for plotting the information
       slot of a given event type. It is usually activated by
       <B>evanalyzer</B>.

       <B>evgraph</B> <B>keyboard/mouse</B> <B>controls</B>


              Up/Down arrows -
                   Change the resolution of the plot.

              Right/Left arrows -
                   Translate plot horizontally.

              Middle mouse button -
                   Drag plot horizontally.
