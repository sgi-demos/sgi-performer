<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       <B>makeIBRimages</B>  -  OpenGL  Performer  tool  for  generating
       images for image-based rendering


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>makeIBRimages</B> infile1 [ options ]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Program <B>makeIBRimages</B> is one of  the  tool  programs  dis-
       tributed with the OpenGL Performer high-performance graph-
       ics library.  Its source  is  located  in  /usr/share/Per-
       former/src/conv/.  It can be used to create images (views)
       of the specified object from a  set  of  directions.   The
       input  is  a file that can be read by OpenGL Performer and
       the output is a set of images of that object that  can  be
       directly  used as an input for a pfIBRtexture.  The images
       are stored in a directory specified using the option -f.

       If a text file 'info' is present in the output directory a
       set  of 3D views is rendered. The file has the same syntax
       as described above.  Each line of the info  file  contains
       two  values:  the  angle from the horizontal plane and how
       many views are created for that angle. The images are then
       indexed  by  two  integer  values that are appended to the
       name specified by the option -f. The first  value  is  the
       index  of the ring of views and the second one indexes the
       views within the ring.

       If the info file is not present a set of N views  (set  by
       the  option  -n) is computed around the object using hori-
       zontal angle of  0.   In  this  case  only  one  index  is
       appended to the image name.

       If option -pfb is specified the program outputs a pfb file
       in the specified directory. The  file  contains  a  single
       pfIBRnode that uses the created images. Note: before load-
       ing in perfly make sure that PFPATH is set to  the  direc-
       tory with all images.

       To  obtain  the  full  set of command line options run the
       program <B>makeIBRimages</B> without any parameters.

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       If your machine does not support a single-buffered  visual
       with  at least 8 bits per red, green, blue, and alpha com-
       ponent the images may be missing alpha  channel.  See  the
       number  of  alpha  bits  printed  at  the beginning of the
       <B>makeIBRimages</B>.
