<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>cfly</B>  is  one  of the sample programs distributed with the
       OpenGL Performer high-performance graphics library.   <B>cfly</B>
       is  an implementation of <B>perfly</B> for SGI PC-clusters.  <B>cfly</B>
       treats each PC screen in the cluster as a graphic pipe  on
       a multi-pipe SGI workstation.

       <B>cfly</B>  brings  up a window (or full screen) on each cluster
       console. By default, it breaks the field of view  horizon-
       tally  starting  the leftmost portion on the first cluster
       host and advancing towards the right.  All program  events
       are  read  on the first host. In other words, you can only
       control cfly (GUI, mouse events, keyboard events) from the
       leftmost console.

       <B>cfly</B>  is  a sample implementation demonstrating how to use
       the <B>DataSync</B> API for writing multi-screen cluster applica-
       tions.   The <B>DataSync</B> daemon <B>dsyncd</B> must be running on one
       of the cluster nodes before starting <B>cfly</B>.


   <B>Starting</B> <B>cfly</B>
       For the sake of the discussion, we assume the master  node
       of the cluster is <B>master-channel</B>.

       Each  one  of  the cluster nodes runs an identical copy of
       the program cfly. You can either run cfly manually on each
       node,  or  use a script that runs them from a single node.
       The following section demonstrates each one of these oper-
       ation modes using the data file: town_ogl.pfb.

       If  you  wish  to run each node separately, enter (on each
       node):


           % setenv PFSERVER master-channel
           % cfly town_ogl.pfb


       Start at the leftmost node and advance to the right. As
       new nodes start, cfly breaks the viewer field of view
       among all the available nodes from left to right in the
       order that they were activated.

       If you wish to start cfly from a single node, first make
       channel:


           % run_all_cfly town_ogl.pfb


       <B>run_all_cfly</B> start up ImageSync video synchronization,
       brings up a remote shell on each on each cluster node and
       runs a script for setting environment variables and run-
       ning cfly.  Here is the contents of the script
       <B>run_all_cfly</B>:


           #!/bin/csh

           # start ImageSync.
           /usr/share/ImageSync/bin/imagesync -v

           # Start cfly application on all channels listed in /etc/channel_list
           # Channels should be listed from left to right to ensure correct
           # breakup of the cfly field of view.
           set list=`cat /etc/channel_list`

           # assume DataSync server runs on master node (this host)
           set server=`hostname`

           set c=0
           set i=2

           while ( $c &lt;  $list[1] )
             rsh $list[$i] /usr/bin/X11/run_cfly $server $* &amp;

             @ c = ($c + 1)
             @ i = ($i + 1)
             sleep 3
           end


       The script <B>run_cfly</B> reads:


           #!/bin/csh

           setenv PFSERVER $1
           setenv DISPLAY :0
           setenv __GL_SYNC_TO_VBLANK 1

           shift
           /usr/bin/X11/cfly $*


       Note that <B>run_all_cfly</B> uses /etc/channel_list for a list
       of channels ordered from left to right. If you change the
       host names of your cluster nodes, you have to update
       /etc/channel_list.

       You can also use the script <B>run_cfly</B> in order to start
       <B>cfly</B> on a single node. <B>run_cfly</B> expects the <B>DataSync</B> dae-
       mon node hostname as its first parameter. In addition to
       all user control is identical to that of <B>perfly</B>. See man-
       ual page for <B>perfly</B> for details.

       <B>cfly</B> has one new parameter to the perfly command line flag
       <B>-H</B>.  This flag now takes four parameters (instead of
       three): <B>horiz_fov</B>,<B>vert_fov</B>,<B>h_offset</B>,<B>v_offset</B>.  They set
       custom field-of-view and viewing offset in the horizontal
       and vertical directions.  This option is useful for over-
       riding the automatic projection parameter setting of <B>cfly</B>.


   <B>Package</B> <B>dependencies</B>
       <B>cfly</B> uses DataSync (libds).


   <B>Trouble</B> <B>Shooting</B>
       <B>Channels</B> <B>come</B> <B>up</B> <B>with</B> <B>wrong</B> <B>horizontal</B> <B>offsets.</B>

       The channels listed in /etc/channel_list may be out of
       order. They should be ordered from left to right.

       <B>Channels</B> <B>do</B> <B>not</B> <B>start</B> <B>at</B> <B>all</B>

       Verify that the <B>DataSync</B> daemon (<B>dsyncd</B>) is running on the
       same node where you started <B>run_all_cfly</B> (for best load-
       balancing, <B>dsyncd</B> should run on the master channel).

       Verify that all channel nodes have xhost enabled.

   <B>Learning</B> <B>More</B>
       Once you've seen OpenGL Performer in action, you will want
       to learn more about it.  The OpenGL Performer Programming
       Guide and the OpenGL Performer Release Notes are the pri-
       mary sources of information, but the a number of informa-
       tion sources are available to give you a good start in
       your learning process. The origin of this quest is the
       Performer man page. Just type "man performer" and just
       about everything you might want to know will be there or
       in one of the on-line resources listed there.
