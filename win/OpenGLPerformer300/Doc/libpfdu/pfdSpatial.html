pfdSpatialize(3pf)                             pfdSpatialize(3pf)




</PRE>
<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       <B>pfdSpatialize,</B>  <B>pfdTravGetGSets</B>  -  Collect  and partition
       pfGeoSets in scene graphs.


</PRE>
<H2>FUNCTION SPECIFICATION</H2><PRE>
       #include &lt;Performer/pfdu.h&gt;

       pfGroup *   <B>pfdSpatialize</B>(pfGroup *group,  float maxGeode-
                     Size, int maxGeoSets);

       pfList *    <B>pfdTravGetGSets</B>(pfNode *node);


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>pfdSpatialize</B>  gathers  together  all the <B>pfGeoSets</B> refer-
       enced in the graph rooted at <I>group</I>.  It constructs  a  new
       subgraph  where  all the <B>pfGeoSets</B> are grouped together by
       their spatial location. An octree is used to  control  the
       grouping.  It  is  ensured  that  no  more than <I>maxGeoSets</I>
       <B>pfGeoSets</B> will be grouped together in one <B>pfGeode</B> and that
       the  spatial width of every individual <B>pfGeode</B> constructed
       will never exceed <I>maxGeodeSize</I>. The new graph is  returned
       to the caller.

       <B>pfdTravGetGSets</B> traverses the graph rooted at <I>node</I> to find
       all the referenced pfGeoSets.   A  list  containing  every
       pfGeoSet  found  by  this  traversal  is  returned  to the
       caller.
