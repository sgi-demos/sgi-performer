       <B>Filename</B> - Reading and writing islAppearances to files

<H2>FUNCTION SPECIFICATION</H2><PRE>
       #include &lt;Performer/pfdu.h&gt;

       islAppearance *   <B>pfdLoadAppearance</B>(const char *filename);

       int               <B>pfdStoreAppearance</B>(const char *filename,
                           islAppearance *appearance);

       char
                         *            <B>pfdGetAppearanceFilename</B>(islAppearance *appearance);

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       These functions implement  islAppearance  file  operations
       which  are  not yet provided by the OpenGL Shader library.
       These functions are used by  Performer  when  loading  and
       saving pfb files.

       <B>pfdLoadAppearance</B>  is used to load an islAppearance from a
       simple XML file format. A value of  NULL  is  returned  if
       loading  fails  for  any reason, otherwise a pointer to an
       islAppearance is returned.

       <B>pfdStoreAppearance</B> writes the specified <I>appearance</I> to  the
       specified <I>filename</I>. A non-zero return value indicates suc-
       cess, while a zero return value indicates  failure.  <I>file-</I>
       <I>name</I>  may  be NULL, in which case a filename will be auto-
       matically generated via the <B>pfdGetAppearanceFilename</B> func-
       tion.  <B>pfdStoreAppearance</B> saves all the shaders within the
       <I>appearance</I>, the values of all their respective  variables,
       and all shader include paths.

       <B>pfdGetAppearanceFilename</B> returns the name of the file from
       which <I>appearance</I> was originally loaded. If  an  appearance
       was  not loaded from a file but rather created programati-
       cally, <B>pfdGetAppearanceFilename</B>  will  generate  a  unique
       name.  This function is necessary since there is no way to
       associate user data with an islAppearance  nor  do  islAp-
       pearances  keep track of their filenames but a filename is
       needed when saving to a pfb file.
