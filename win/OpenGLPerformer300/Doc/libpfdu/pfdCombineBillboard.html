<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       <B>pfdCombineBillboards</B> - Merge pfBillboard nodes together.


</PRE>
<H2>FUNCTION SPECIFICATION</H2><PRE>
       #include &lt;Performer/pfdu.h&gt;

       void   <B>pfdCombineBillboards</B>(pfNode *node, int sizeLimit);

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>pfdCombineBillboards</B>   gathers   sibling  billboard  nodes
       together into as few large pfBillboard nodes as  possible.
       This  can  often increase the efficiency of billboard pro-
       cessing in databases with large numbers of single-pfGeoSet
       pfBillboard  nodes,  such  as  the  OpenGL  Performer Town
       database. The <I>sizeLimit</I> argument defines an upper limit to
       the  merging  process. No pfBillboard node will be made to
       have more than this number of pfGeoSets,  and  no  pfBill-
       board  node  already  having more than this number will be
       modified during the traversal.

       There are a  few  requirements  and  restrictions  to  the
       pfBillboard  combination  process.  In order to be merged,
       pfBillboard nodes must be both <I>similar</I> and <I>combinable</I>.

       For a pair of pfBillboard nodes to be  <I>similar</I>  they  must
       each   have   the   same   values  for  their  pfBillboard
       attributes. The attributes of pfBillboard nodes are:

              Mode      Both pfBillboard nodes must have the same
                        rotation     mode.    The    modes    are
                        PFBB_AXIAL_ROT,  PFBB_POINT_ROT_EYE,  and
                        PFBB_POINT_ROT_WORLD.

              Axis      Both pfBillboard nodes must have the same
                        axis of rotation. The  axis  is  compared
                        using  <B>pfAlmostEqualVec3</B> with a tolerance
                        of 0.0001.

       In order for two pfBillboard nodes to be  considered  <I>com-</I>
       <I>binable</I>, two additional conditions must be met:

              Size      The destination pfBillboard node must not
                        be  too  big.   The  argument   <I>sizeLimit</I>
                        defines  the  maximum number if pfGeoSets
                        that any combined node  may  contain,  so
                        nodes  that  already  have at least <I>size-</I>
                        <I>Limit</I> pfGeoSets will  not  receive  addi-
                        tional pfGeoSets.

              Safe      Both   pfBillboard   nodes   being   com-
                        bined--the one giving  up  pfGeoSets  and
                        the  one  receiving  them--must  be unin-
                        stanced nodes. This means that each  node
                        has  only  one parent. This situation can
                        be forced if desired by calling <B>pfFlatten</B>
