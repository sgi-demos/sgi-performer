<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>pfdClipTextureNodeUpdate</B>  is  a  simple  callback function
       that can be attached to a node to update a clip texture in
       a  simple  incremental  way.   This  function  is designed
       solely for testing purposes but shows how a user might use
       the clip centering api to update a clipmap.

       <B>pfdLoadClipTextureState</B>   works   like  <B>pfdLoadClipTexture</B>
       except that it takes an additional argument, a pointer  to
       a  <B>pfuClipTexConfig</B> structure. Normally the parser creates
       and initializes its own <B>pfuClipTexConfig</B> structure to  the
       default  values set by <B>pfuInitClipTexConfig</B>. This function
       uses the the structure passed by the  <I>state</I>  parameter  as
       its starting point. This allows the application to set its
       own <I>state</I> values programmatically, and use the  parser  to
       fill  in  the remaining ones. The parser doesn't check the
       <I>state</I> values, so it will overwrite  a  value  set  in  the
       <I>state</I>  structure  if it encounters the corresponding token
       in its config file.

       <B>pfdLoadClipTexture</B> accepts a string containing the path to
       a  configuration  file describing a <B>pfClipTexture</B>. It con-
       figures and creates a clip texture,  and  then  returns  a
       pointer to it.

       A  clip  texture  is a type of texture map used for repre-
       senting very large textures. Large clipmap levels are com-
       posed of image caches, which require only a part of a tex-
       ture level to be in the graphics hardware's  texture  mem-
       ory.

       The clip texture configuration file contains a description
       of the clip texture, including the locations of  the  clip
       texture  image  files, the tile files for the smaller lev-
       els, as well as the clip texture's size, format, and other
       details.

       The  configuration  files  are in a tokenized format; each
       stylistic convenience. They are:

              "#" (shell style comment)

              "//" (C++ style comment)

              ";" (LISP-style comment)

              "comment" (ALGOL-style comment)

              "rem" (BASIC-style comment for die-hards)

       A comment starts with a comment token and continues  until
       the end of that line.

       Some  tokens  and  their data fields may be omitted if the
       default value is desired. These are marked with  asterisks
       (*)  in  the  list  below. If a token is in the file, it's
       data field <B>must</B> be included.  The  current  implementation
       requires  that the tokens that do appear in the configura-
       tion file follow the ordering shown in the list below.

       Some tokens form groups. Tokens that are normally optional
       may  not  be  if  another token in it's group is specified
       with  a  non-default  value.   The  interdependencies  are
       described below.

       <B>Clip</B> <B>Texture</B> <B>Configuration</B> <B>Format</B>


       ct_version1.0 or ct_version2.0 must be at top of file
       ext_format &lt;format string&gt; (external format of stored texels)
       int_format &lt;format string&gt; (internal format used by graphics hw)
       img_format &lt;format string&gt; (image format of stored texels)
       virt_size  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; (size of entire texture)
       clip_size  &lt;int&gt; (size of square of texture levels in hardware)

       *effective_levels &lt;int&gt; (number of effective levels of virtual clip texture)
       *allocated_levels &lt;int&gt; (number of levels with texture memory allocated)

       *invalid_border  &lt;int&gt; (width of clip region perimeter not to use)
       *smallest_icache &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; (smallest icache level dimensions)

       *icache_base   &lt;file path string&gt; (root of icache config filenames)
       *icache_format &lt;scanf string&gt; (icache fnames: no field? list files)
       *num_icache_params &lt;int&gt; (obsolete; ignored by parser)
       *icache_params &lt;string list&gt; (format tokens in order)

       *header_offset &lt;int&gt; (byte offset to skip user's tile file headers)
       *tile_base   &lt;file path string&gt; (root of pyramid tile filenames)
       *tile_format &lt;scanf string&gt; (tile fnames: no field? list tile files)
       *tile_params   &lt;string list&gt; (format tokens in order)

       *icache_files &lt;list of filenames&gt; (only if icache_format is default )
       *tile_files &lt;list of filenames&gt; (pyramid; only if tile_format default)

       *tile_size   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; if no image cache config files
       *read_func   &lt;1 or 2 strings&gt; (custom read function, dso library its in)
       *lookahead   &lt;int&gt;  extra tiles surrounding tex region in mem region
       fields.  One of these tokens must start the configuration
       file. These tokens allow programs to determine the type
       and version of the configuration file.

       <B>ext_format</B> expects a Performer external format type. This
       can be a token name, such as PFTEX_PACK_8, or a numeric
       value.

       <B>int_format</B> expects a Performer internal format type. This
       can be a token name, such as PFTEX_RGB_8, or a numeric
       value.

       <B>img_format</B> expects a Performer image format type. This can
       be a token name, such as PFTEX_RGB, or a numeric value.

       <B>virt_size</B> takes three integer arguments, which describe
       the s, t, and r dimensions of the entire image cache, mea-
       sured in texels. This value is mandatory.

       <B>clip_size</B> takes a single integer argument, which describes
       the texel dimensions of the square part of each level of
       the clip texture kept resident in hardware texture memory.

       <B>invalid_border</B> takes a single integer argument, describing
       how many texels the clip size should be shrunk in each
       dimension. This value is used to ensure a smooth transi-
       tion between the clip texture levels.

       <B>effective_levels</B> takes a single integer argument, describ-
       ing how many effective levels the clipmap should have.
       Making the number of effective levels less than the number
       of virtual levels (log2(virt_size)+1) makes the clip tex-
       ture virtual, requiring intelligent runtime setting of the
       virtual LOD offset to trade between high precision and
       high spatial range.  The default value is 16.  On
       InfiniteReality, the maximum number of effective levels is
       16, so a clip texture of size greater than 32Kx32K is
       always virtual.  Note also that on InfiniteReality, there
       is a significant increase in texture memory required when
       a clip texture is virtual: every pyramid level, no matter
       how small, takes up a full clip_size worth of texture mem-
       ory.

       <B>allocated_levels</B> takes a single integer argument, describ-
       ing how many clip texture levels actually have texture
       memory allocated for them.  Virtual cliptextures can only
       display levels that are allocated in texture memory. The
       texture levels are allocated starting from level zero.

       <B>smallest_icache</B> takes three integer values, describing the
       dimensions of the smallest icache level in the clip tex-
       ture. Every level smaller than these dimensions are
       described by individual image tile filenames. The s and t
       dimensions of <B>smallest_icache</B> must be exactly proportional
       to the s and t dimensions of  <B>virt_size</B> differing only by
       a power of two ratio. If <B>smallest_icache</B> is omitted, the
       first level whose largest dimension matches <B>tile_size</B> is
       the largest image tile level. Thus the maximum default
       value of <B>smallest_icache</B> would be <B>clip_size</B> * 2.
       The <B>icache_base</B> field can start with an optional environ-
       ment variable name.  The environment variable name must
       start the field, and start with a '$' (dollar sign) char-
       acter. The environment variable name can be delineated in
       the usual way, using parenthesis or braces; for example
       $(FNAME) or ${FNAME}.  The $FNAME style format can be used
       if the variable name is unambiguous in the field. The
       environment variable name will be replaced by its value in
       the field. If the variable is undefined, it will be
       expanded to "" (the empty string).  To specify a default
       value to be used in the case that the variable is not set,
       use the form ${FNAME:-DEFAULT} or $(FNAME:-DEFAULT).  The
       <B>icache_base</B> token is obsolecent; its use is discouraged.

       The <B>icache_base</B> field can be a relative pathname. The
       pathname is expanded relative to where the configuration
       file was found.

       <B>icache_format</B> is a printf-style string containing a
       description of the variable part of the image cache file-
       names. If you omit <B>icache_format</B>, you must also omit
       <B>icache_params</B>, and include <B>icache_files</B>, explicitly list-
       ing all of the image cache files.

       If no <B>icache_base</B> is defined, the <B>icache_format</B> field can
       start with an optional environment variable name.  The
       environment variable name must start the field, and start
       with a '$' (dollar sign) character. The environment vari-
       able name can be delineated in the usual way, using paren-
       thesis or braces; for example $(FNAME) or ${FNAME}.  The
       $FNAME style format can be used if the variable name is
       unambiguous in the field. The environment variable name
       will be replaced by its value in the field. If the vari-
       able is undefined, it will be expanded to "" (the empty
       string).  To specify a default value to be used in the
       case that the variable is not set, use the form
       ${FNAME:-DEFAULT} or $(FNAME:-DEFAULT).

       If no <B>icache_base</B> is defined, the <B>icache_format</B> field can
       be a relative pathname. The pathname is expanded relative
       to where the configuration file was found.

       If <B>icache_format</B> is omitted, the default filename string
       is "%s%s". By default, this string uses the <B>icache_base</B>
       for the first argument (or "" the empty string if there no
       <B>icache_base</B> argument), followed by one of the image cache
       filenames provided by <B>icache_files</B>. The clip texture is
       created by using each image cache file name in order, one
       for each image cache level. The first image cache filename
       in <B>icache_files</B> is used for the first (largest) image
       cache level in the clip texture.

       <B>num_icache_params</B> is obsolete and is ignored by the
       parser.

       <B>icache_params</B> is followed by a whitespace separated list
       containing some combination of the following token names:

              PFCLIPTEX_FNAMEARG_LEVEL

       The number of items on the list must match the number of
       parameter specifications in the <B>icache_format</B> string.
       This list is mandatory if there are any parameter specifi-
       cations in the <B>icache_format</B> string.


       <B>header_offset</B> is the size, in bytes, of any application-
       specific header information at the beginning of each file.
       If there is no application header information, this value
       should be set to 0, which is the default value if this
       field is omitted. The header offset is only applied to the
       image tiles described in the cliptexture. Header offsets
       for the files used in clip texture's image caches are
       described in the image cache configuration files.


       <B>tile_base</B> defines the directory path and constant begin-
       ning of the image tile filenames. It is a convenience fea-
       ture, making it easy to repoint a configuration file to
       data in a different directory. If omitted, <B>tile_base</B>
       defaults to "" (empty string).  The <B>tile_base</B> token is
       obsolecent; its use is discouraged.

       The <B>tile_base</B> field can start with an optional environment
       variable name.  The environment variable name must start
       the field, and start with a '$' (dollar sign) character.
       The environment variable name can be delineated in the
       usual way, using parenthesis or braces; for example
       $(FNAME) or ${FNAME}.  The $FNAME style format can be used
       if the variable name is unambiguous in the field. The
       environment variable name will be replaced by its value in
       the field. If the variable is undefined, it will be
       expanded to "" (the empty string).

       The <B>tile_base</B> field can be a relative pathname. The path-
       name is expanded relative to where the configuration file
       was found.

       <B>tile_format</B> is a printf-style string containing a descrip-
       tion of the variable part of the image tile filenames. If
       you omit <B>icache_format</B>, you must also omit <B>tile_params</B>,
       and include <B>tile_files</B>, explicitly listing all of the
       image cache files.

       If no <B>tile_base</B> is defined, the <B>tile_format</B> field can
       start with an optional environment variable name.  The
       environment variable name must start the field, and start
       with a '$' (dollar sign) character. The environment vari-
       able name can be delineated in the usual way, using paren-
       thesis or braces; for example $(FNAME) or ${FNAME}.  The
       $FNAME style format can be used if the variable name is
       unambiguous in the field. The environment variable name
       will be replaced by its value in the field. If the vari-
       able is undefined, it will be expanded to "" (the empty
       string).

       If no <B>tile_base</B> is defined, the <B>tile_format</B> field can be a
       relative pathname. The pathname is expanded relative to
       where the configuration file was found.
       for each tile level. The first tile file filename in
       <B>tile_files</B> is used for the first (largest) image tile
       level in the clip texture.

       <B>num_tile_params</B> is obsolete and ignored by the parser.

       <B>tile_params</B> is followed by a whitespace separated list
       containing some combination of the following token names:

       <B>tile_size</B> should be set if the application doesn't use
       image cache configuration files. Image cache configuration
       files can be dispensed with if the image caches in the
       cliptexture differ only in size from level to level. If no
       image cache config files are supplied, the tile format
       supplied in the clip texture configuration file is used to
       find disk files for both the image tile levels and the
       image tiles used in the configuration files. Image cache
       configuration files should not be referenced in the clip
       texture configuration file if the application doesn't want
       to use them.

       <B>page_size</B> takes a single integer value. This value is by
       the system when allocating image tile texel data memory.
       The data is aligned to the page size so that direct i/o
       reads from disk are possible. Setting the proper page size
       value can improve memory usage over the default conserva-
       tive value.

       <B>lookahead</B> takes a single integer, which indicates the num-
       ber of extra rows and columns of (beyond the amount needed
       to cover the tex region) tiles used to compute the mem
       region size. The configuration system uses the mem region
       size if it is supplied, or computes the size based on the
       tile size and tex region size. It chooses a mem region
       size so that the tex region can be covered, even if it is
       not aligned with the tile boundaries.

       The default lookahead value 1 one, which means there is an
       extra row and column of tiles in the mem region beyond the
       minimum required to prevent errors. Setting a lookahead
       value in the cliptexture configuration file sets the
       lookahead for all the cliptexture's image caches, unless
       the value is set in an image cache config file. In that
       case, the image cache lookahead value takes precidence for
       that image cache.

       <B>read_func</B> takes one or two arguments. If the custom read
       function is in the application's executable, then a single
       argument giving the function name is sufficient. Otherwise
       two arguments should be provided, one for the DSO library
       containing the custom read function, the second being the
       function name itself. If supplied the custom read function
       will be used in place of the default in the clip texture's
       read queue.

              PFCLIPTEX_FNAMEARG_LEVEL

              PFCLIPTEX_FNAMEARG_LEVEL_SIZE

       specifications in the <B>tile_format</B> string.

       <B>icache_files</B> is followed by a whitespace separated list of
       image cache filenames. This entry should only be present
       if <B>icache_format</B> is missing.  Each filename in the list is
       used, in order to create the icache levels of the cliptex-
       ture. They should be ordered from largest to smallest
       icache level.  The filenames are pre-pended with
       <B>icache_base</B> before used.

       <B>tile_files</B> is followed by a whitespace separated list of
       image tile file filenames. This entry should only be pre-
       sent if <B>tile_format</B> is missing.  Each filename in the list
       is used, in order to create the tile (pyramid) levels of
       the cliptexture. They should be ordered from largest to
       smallest tile level. The filenames are pre-pended with
       <B>tile_base</B> before used.

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       ClipTexture functionality is not supported under Linux.



</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       The parser that reads configuration files is very limited.
       In particular, it only allows comments where it would be
       expecting a token.

       The the use of cliptexture configuration files without
       image cache configuration files is not well tested.
