<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Forming independent triangles  into  triangle  strips  (or
       meshes) can significantly improve rendering performance on
       most systems.  Strips reduce the amount of  work  required
       by  the CPU, bus, and graphics subsystem.  The OpenGL Per-
       former utility mesher is adapted from  the  triangle  mesh
       code supplied in "/usr/people/4Dgifts".  It is modified to
       work with Performer <B>pfGeoSet</B> data structures and is  opti-
       mized for optimal performance.

       <B>pfdMeshGSet</B>  takes as input a <B>pfGeoSet</B> consisting of inde-
       pendent triangles, (<B>PFGS_TRIS</B>).  The input may  be  either
       indexed  or  non-indexed.   This routine outputs the input
       <B>pfGeoSet</B> if it cannot strip the input or a single <B>pfGeoSet</B>
       that  is  a collection of triangle strips (PFGS_<B>TRISTRIPS</B>)
       if it is successful.  The output <B>pfGeoSet</B>  is  non-indexed
       and  the input <B>pfGeoSet</B> is not deleted although the appli-
       cation generally should do so to avoid wasted memory.

       The mesher attempts to maximize the average length of tri-
       angle  strips  inside <I>gset</I>.  The code is complex but works
       well and can significantly improve drawing performance  if
       the  average number of triangles in the triangle strips in
       the output GeoSets is at least four.  The length of trian-
       gle  strips  necessary to achieve peak drawing performance
       is dependent on the exact hardware configuration.

       <B>pfdMesherMode</B> sets the mode that the mesher will use  when
       forming  triangle  strips.   Currently  two modes are sup-
       ported:

              <B>PFDMESH_SHOW_TSTRIPS</B>
                   Generate a  random  color  for  each  triangle
                   strip  generated.   This  is a diagnostic mode
                   which is extremely useful in understanding the
                   structure  and  efficiency  of databases.  The
                   OpenGL  Performer  sample  application  <B>perfly</B>
                   supports the specification of this mode on the
                   command line via the "-O1" flag.  Type "perfly
                   -help"  for  full  instructions.   The default
                   disabled from the command line.  Type  "perfly
                   -O4   ...."  to  enable  retessellation.   The
                   default value is <B>TRUE</B>.

              <B>PFDMESH_INDEXED</B>
                   Will construct indexed  triangle  strips.   If
                   the  pfdBuilder mode <B>PFDBLDR_SHARE_INDEX_LISTS</B>
                   is set, the index lists will be shared between
                   the different vertex attribute lists.

              <B>pfdGetMesherMode</B>  returns  the  current  setting of
              <I>mode</I>.

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       If <B>pfdMeshGSet</B> generates a set of  triangle  strips  whose
       lengths  are  all three or four i.e. they are all indepen-
       dent triangles or quads, the output <B>pfGeoSet</B>  will  be  of
       type <B>PFGS_TRIS</B> or <B>PFGS_QUADS</B>, respectively.

       <B>pfdMeshGSet</B>  also  calls <B>pfuHashGSetVerts</B> which may delete
       the attribute and index  arrays  of  the  input  <B>pfGeoSet</B>.
       Thus  you  may  wish  to  <B>pfRef</B> your arrays to avoid their
       deletion.

       <B>pfdShowStrips</B> will assign each  triangle  strip  a  random
       color.   The first triangle in each strip is distinguished
       by being slightly darker than the rest of the strip

       The libpfdu source code, object code and documentation are
       provided as unsupported software.  Routines are subject to
       change in future releases.
