<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       It  is obviously desirable to share state between database
       objects in OpenGL Performer whenever possible.  The notion
       of pervasive state sharing underpins the entire <B>pfGeoState</B>
       mechanism.  Common data such as  texture,  materials,  and
       lighting  models  are  often  duplicated in many different
       objects throughout a database.  This collection  of  func-
       tions provides the means necessary to easily achieve shar-
       <B>pfdGetGlobalShare</B>  returns  the global <B>pfdShare</B> structure.
       This structure is used by both the <B>pfdBuilder</B> and by load-
       ers that do not use the <B>pfdBuilder</B>.

       <B>pfdSetGlobalShare</B> sets the global <B>pfdShare</B> structure.

       <B>pfdDelShare</B>  deletes  a <B>pfdShare</B> structure.  If <I>deepDelete</I>
       is non-NULL, all the data referenced by the <B>pfdShare</B>  will
       also be deleted.

       <B>pfdPrintShare</B>  will print statistics about how many object
       references are being held in the given sharing  structure.

       <B>pfdCountShare</B>  returns  the total number of shared objects
       referenced by the given sharing structure.

       Each <B>pfdShare</B> structure maintains lists of shared  objects
       with  distinct  types of objects stored in distinct lists.
       <B>pfdGetSharedList</B> returns the list of shared objects of the
       given type.

       <B>pfdNewSharedObject</B>   returns   a  shared  object  matching
       <I>object</I>.  If a matching object was already present  in  the
       sharing  structure,  that  object is returned.  If no such
       object exists, a new object is created using <I>object</I>  as  a
       template.   This  new  object  is entered into the sharing
       structure and is returned to the caller.

       <B>pfdFindSharedObject</B>  looks  through  the  given   pfdShare
       structure  for  an  object  matching  <I>object</I>.   A  NULL is
       returned if no matching object is found.

       <B>pfdAddSharedObject</B> adds <I>object</I> to the given sharing struc-
       ture, if it is not already present.  The object's index in
       the sharing list is returned.

       <B>pfdRemoveSharedObject</B> removes <I>object</I> from the given  shar-
       ing  structure,  if  it is present.  The object's index in
       the sharing list is returned.  The object  is  deleted  if
       its reference count reaches zero via <B>pfUnrefDelete</B>.

       <B>pfdMakeShared</B> can be used to force sharing of state within
       an already existing scene graph.   It  will  traverse  the
       graph  rooted at <I>node</I> looking for duplicate state objects.
       Any references to such objects will be made to point to  a
       single shared copy, and the duplicates will be freed.

       <B>pfdMakeSharedScene</B> is similar to pfdMakeShared except that
       it works on  a  scene  and  computes  an  optimal  pfScene
       pfGeoState  based  on all of the pfGeoStates referenced in
       <I>scene</I>  (see  <B>pfdMakeSceneGState</B>  for  further  information
       about  the  scene  pfGeoState  computation  itself).   The
       pfGeoStates in <I>scene</I> are then optimized based on  the  new
       scene  GeoState  (see <B>pfdOptimizeGStateList</B>).  Lastly, the
       optimized pfGeoState is assigned as the scene's pfGeoState
       so  that  the  inheritance  for the newly optimized states
       will be effective (see <B>pfSceneGState</B>).

       <B>pfdCleanShare</B> removes all shared objects that  are  refer-
       <B>pfdGetNodeGStateList</B>  creates  and  returns  a  pfList  of
       unique  pfGeoStates  that are referenced by geometry under
       <I>node</I>.
