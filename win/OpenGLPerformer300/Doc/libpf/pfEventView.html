<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       OpenGL Performer is instrumented to generate internal tim-
       ing events and write them into  a  file  upon  application
       program  request.  Each event has a start time a nd an end
       time. Together they bind the execution of important  parts
       of  a Performer frame in the various Perforfmer processes.

       The captured event durations are similar to the  durations
       presented  in  <B>pfFrameStats</B>. However, <B>EventView</B> events can
       be written to a file and analyzed offline - after the exe-
       cution  of a Performer program completes.  In addition, an
       application program can design its private set  of  events
       and  can  merge them into the same output file as the Per-
       former internal events.

       OpenGL  Performer  supplies  an  analysis  program  called
       <B>evanalyzer</B>  for  generating  a graphic display of the cap-
       tured events.

       <B>pfInitializeEvents</B>  initializes  the  internal   Performer
       event  capture  mechanism.  An  application must call this
       function before calling <B>pfConfig</B> in  order  to  initialize
       the event-capture data structures. All other event capture
       functions should be called after <B>pfInitializeEvents</B>.

       <B>pfEventSampleOn</B> starts event capturing. Immediately  after
       this  function  is  called, all Performer generated timing
       events will be logged for future saving into a file.  Per-
       former  will  log  a  limited  number of events (currently
       10000 events). No events will be logged after  this  limit
       is reached.

       <B>pfEventSampleOff</B>  stops event capturing. No events will be
       logged after this call.

       <B>pfWriteEvents</B> writes out the currently logged events  into
       a  disk  file  <I>filename</I>.  The  written events can be later
       The simplest way to use pfEventView is to  use  only  Per-
       former-internal events.  In this case, an application pro-
       gram may look like:


       main()
       {
           pfInit();

           // Initialize event capture.
           pfInitializeEvents();

           pfConfig();

           // Create window &amp; scene graph.
           ....

           // Start event capture
           pfEventSampleOn();

           for (i = 0 ; i &lt; numFrames ; i ++)
           {
               pfSync();
               pfFrame();
           }

           // Stop event capture.
           pfEventSampleOff();

           // Write to file.
           pfWriteEvents("events.timefile");
       }


       After the program completes, one can analyze the generated
       events using the command: <I>evanalyzer</I> <I>events.timefile</I>.


   <B>Sample</B> <B>use</B> <B>of</B> <B>pfEventView:</B>
   <B>A</B> <B>more</B> <B>complex</B> <B>case.</B>
       In a more complex case, an application has some private
       events that it wishes to add to the captured event file.
       We achieve this in two stages:

       <B>Stage</B> <B>I:</B>
       We define application private events in a file. The fol-
       lowing example defines a single event named <I>myDrawCB</I> and
       assigns a single information slot of type integer for this
       event.


       file "myEvents.timefile";
       max_events 10000;
       c_file "myEvents.c";
       h_file "myEvents.h";

       active true;

       conditional_sampling true;
                name "Something" ;
                type int ;
                };
           };


       Running <B>evpp</B> on above file creates the two files
       <I>myEvents.c</I> and <I>myEvents.h</I>. The application should compile
       and link with the newly generated file <I>myEvents.c</I>. The
       file <I>myEvents.h</I> contains macros that the application uses
       for controling event capture.

       <B>Stage</B> <B>II:</B>
       In the application code below, we generate an event of
       type myDrawCB in a DRAW callback of some node in the scene
       graph. Every time we generate an event, we assign a value
       to its information slot:



       int pre_draw_cb(pfTraverser *trav, void *userData)
       {
           int        someValue;

           // Mark the start of private event MyDrawCB.
           EVENT_START_MYDRAWCB;

           // Assign value to the information field of this event.
           EVENT_MYDRAWCB_INFO_CB_Info (someValue);

           ... Run callback code.

           // Mark the end of private event MyDrawCB.
           EVENT_END_MYDRAWCB;
       }

       main()
       {
           pfGeode *geode;

           pfInit();

           // Initialize Performer-internal event capture.
           pfInitializeEvents();

           // Initialize application-private event capture.
           EVENT_INIT;

           pfConfig();

           // Create window &amp; scene graph.
           ....

           // Setup DRAW callback on a node.
           pfNodeTravFuncs(geode, PFTRAV_DRAW, pre_draw_cb, NULL);

           // Start event capture on all initialized event sets (Performer-internal
           // and application-private).
           EVENT_SAMPLE_ALL_ON;
           // Stop event capture on all initialized event sets..
           EVENT_SAMPLE_ALL_OFF;

           // Write all captured events from all initialized sets to a file.
           // Since we named a file in the evpp input file,
           // we need not specify it here.
           EVENT_WRITE_ALL;
       }



       As in the first example, after the program completes, one
       can analyze the generated events using the command: <I>evana-</I>
       <I>lyzer</I> <I>myEvents.timefile</I>. This time the file contains Per-
       former-internal and application-private (myDrawCB) events.
       Clicking the right-hand mouse button on the line marked
       myDrawCB can toggle the display of the information field
       on this event.

       Note that we didn't have to start/stop sampling of Per-
       former-internal events.  The macros <B>EVENT_SAMPLE_ALL_ON</B>
       and <B>EVENT_SAMPLE_ALL_OFF</B> start and stop sampling for all
       currently initialized event sets.

       The manual page for <B>evpp</B> contains more information about
       generating application-private event types.
