<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A pfIBRtexture stores a set of images of a complex  object
       as  viewed  from different directions.  The directions are
       specified  using  <B>pfIBRtexture::setIBRdirections</B>.   Inter-
       nally,  pfIBRtexture  uses  pfDirData  to store the views.
       pfDirData determines the type of  view  distribution.   It
       could be a set of views around the object, all perpendicu-
       lar to the vertical axis.  Or the views can be  a  set  of
       rings  and  each  ring  contains an array of evenly spaced
       views that have the same angle from the horizontal  plane.
       Otherwise,  the  views are assumed to be uniformly or ran-
       domly distributed around the sphere  of  directions.   The
       directions have to be specified before the images are set.

       Once the directions are specified the images are set using
       <B>pfIBRtexture::setIBRtextures</B>.  The parameters are an array
       of pointer to the textures containing the  views  and  the
       number of the textures in this array.

       If  views  are organized in rings the images can be loaded
       directly     from     a     set     of     files     using
       <B>pfIBRtexture::loadIBRtexture</B>  without  the need to specify
       the directions first.  The parameter <I>format</I> specifies  the
       path  in  which  the images are stored as well as how they
       are  indexed,  for  example,  "images/view%03d.rgb".   The
       other  two parameters specify the number of images and the
       increment between two loaded images (this is  useful  when
       the  texture memory is limited, by specifying <I>step</I>=2 every
       second image is skipped).

       If  the  flag   PFIBR_3D_VIEWS   is   not   set   function
       <B>pfIBRtexture::loadIBRtexture</B>  sets one ring with specified
       number of textures and a horizontal angle of  0.   If  the
       flag PFIBR_3D_VIEWS is set the class checks whether a file
       'info' is present in the image directory.  If  it  is  the
       information  about rings is loaded from that file. It con-
       tain two values at each line - the  horizontal  angle  and
       the  number  of  texture at each ring.  If the file is not
       present in the image directory the directions have  to  be
       function <B>pfIBRtexture::loadIBRtexture</B> should be indexed by
       the ring index and the index of the image in a given ring.
       The  format  string  should  be  set  appropriately,  e.g.
       "images/view%02d_%03d.rgb". In case the textures are spec-
       ified by the user using  <B>pfIBRtexture::setIBRtextures</B>  the
       texture  pointers are all stored in a single array, start-
       ing with textures of the first ring, followed by  textures
       of the second ring, and so on.

       It  is  assumed  that the views in each ring are uniformly
       spaced and they are ordered clockwise with respect to  the
       vertical  axis.  If  the views are ordered in the opposite
       direction,    set    the    direction     to     -1     by
       <B>pfIBRtexture::setDirection</B>.


       At  present,  pfIBRtexture  is  used only by pfIBRnode. It
       provides a draw function for pfGeoSets that belong to  the
       pfIBRnode,  but  the  draw  process  is transparent to the
       user.  The user can control it by setting flags using  the
       function  <B>pfIBRtexture::setFlags</B>.  If the flag PFIBR_NEAR-
       EST is set the closest view is selected and applied  as  a
       texture  of  the  pfGeoSet.  This  approach is fast on all
       platforms, but it results in visible jumps when  the  tex-
       ture is changed.

       Thus  by default the flag PFIBR_NEAREST is not set and two
       to four close views are blended  together,  based  on  the
       distribution  of  the view.  In case of one ring of views,
       two views are blended, in case of several rings  of  views
       four  views  are  blended and in case of uniform or random
       distribution of views 3 views are blended together.

       If the graphics hardware supports register combiners flags
       PFIBR_USE_REG_COMBINERS   and   PFIBR_USE_2D_TEXTURES  are
       automatically set by the class constructor and the  blend-
       ing of textures can be done in one pass.

       On  IRIX, by default the flag PFIBR_USE_2D_TEXTURES is not
       set and a 3D texture is used for fast blending between two
       closest  views.   To  avoid  flickering when the object is
       viewed from a distance additional 3D textures are used  to
       store  additional  mipmap levels This feature is available
       on machines with multisampling only (IR).  To disable  the
       mipmapping,  set flag PFIBR_MIPMAP_3DTEXTURES to zero.  In
       case of several rings, the nearest ring  is  selected  and
       the  views  inside this ring are blended using the 3D tex-
       ture.  3D texture is not compatible with  other  distribu-
       tions  of the views so make sure that in that case you set
       flag PFIBR_USE_2D_TEXTURES.

       Flag PFIBR_USE_PROXY is used when the views are mapped  on
       an  approximation of the complex object (a proxy) and dif-
       ferent version of the draw functions have to  be  applied.
       You  can  read more about proxies in the man page for pfI-
       BRnode.

       See pfIBRnode man page and program sample/pguide/C++/IBRn-
       ode  for  more  details of how to associate a pfIBRtexture

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       When using pfIBRnodes and  pfIBRtextures  in  perfly,  you
       need  an  alpha buffer. If the pfIBRnode is rendered as an
       opaque rectangle try command line parameter  -9  in  which
       case perfly requests a visual with alpha buffer.
