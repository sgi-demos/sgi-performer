       <B>PARENT</B> <B>CLASS</B> <B>FUNCTIONS</B>



       The OpenGL Performer class <B>pfNode</B> is derived from
       the parent class <B>pfObject</B>, so each of these member
       functions of class <B>pfObject</B> are also directly
       usable with objects of class <B>pfNode</B>.  This is also
       true for ancestor classes of class <B>pfObject</B>.

       void*   <B>pfObject::operator</B> <B>new</B>(size_t);
       void*   <B>pfObject::operator</B> <B>new</B>(size_t,
                 void *arena);
       void*   <B>pfObject::operator</B> <B>new</B>(size_t, pfFluxMem-
                 ory *fmem);
       void    <B>pfObject::setUserData</B>(void *data);
       void    <B>pfObject::setUserData</B>(int slot,
                 void *data);
       void*   <B>pfObject::getUserData</B>(pfObject *obj);

                 int slot);
       int     <B>pfObject::getNumUserData</B>();


       Since the class <B>pfObject</B> is itself derived from the
       parent class <B>pfMemory</B>, objects of class <B>pfNode</B> can
       also be used with these functions designed for
       objects of class <B>pfMemory</B>.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A pfNode is an abstract type.  OpenGL Performer
       does not provide any means to explicitly create a
       pfNode.  Rather, the pfNode routines operate on the
       common aspects of other OpenGL Performer node
       types.

       The complete list of OpenGL Performer nodes (all
       derived from pfNode) is:

              <B>pfBillboard</B>

              <B>pfDCS</B>

              <B>pfGeode</B>

              <B>pfGroup</B>

              <B>pfLayer</B>

              <B>pfLightPoint</B>

              <B>pfLightSource</B>

              <B>pfLOD</B>

              <B>pfMorph</B>

              <B>pfPartition</B>

              <B>pfScene</B>

              <B>pfSCS</B>

              <B>pfSequence</B>

              <B>pfSwitch</B>

              <B>pfText</B>

       and callback data.

       <B>pfNode::getClassType</B> returns the <B>pfType</B>* for the
       class <B>pfNode</B>.  The <B>pfType</B>* returned by
       <B>pfNode::getClassType</B> is the same as the <B>pfType</B>*
       returned by invoking the virtual function <B>getType</B>
       on any instance of class <B>pfNode</B>.  Because OpenGL
       Performer allows subclassing of built-in types,
       when decisions are made based on the type of an
       object, it is usually better to use  the member
       function <B>isOfType</B> to test if an object is of a type
       derived from a Performer type rather than to test
       for strict equality of the <B>pfType</B>*'s.

       <B>pfNode::getNumParents</B> returns the number of parents
       the pfNode has in the scene graph.  A node may have
       multiple parents because it was explicitly added to
       multiple parents with <B>pfGroup::addChild</B>. In such
       cases it said to be 'instanced'.  Also, leaf geome-
       try nodes such as pfGeodes, pfLightPoints, and
       pfBillboards, may have multiple parents as a result
       of a <B>pfNode::clone</B>.  <B>pfNode::getParent</B> returns the
       <I>i</I>th parent of the pfNode or <B>NULL</B> if <I>i</I> is out of the
       range 0 to <B>pfNode::getNumParents</B> - 1.

       <B>pfNode::setBound</B> sets the bounding volume of the
       pfNode.  Each pfNode has an associated bounding
       volume used for culling and intersection testing
       and a bounding mode, either static or dynamic.  By
       definition, the bounding volume of a node encloses
       all the geometry parented by node, which means that
       the node and all its children fit within the node's
       bounding volume.

       Only a subset of the pfNode types actually contain
       geometry.  These are known as "leaf nodes" in
       OpenGL Performer. They are:
              <B>pfBillboard</B>
              <B>pfGeode</B>
              <B>pfLightPoint</B>

       These and other nodes may indirectly contain geome-
       try through user-supplied function callbacks set by
       <B>pfNode::setTravFuncs</B>.

       Normally OpenGL Performer automatically computes
       bounding volumes but provides routines to explic-
       itly set bounding volumes.  This is useful for pfN-
       odes which draw custom geometry through node call-
       backs (<B>pfNode::setTravFuncs</B>).

       The <I>bsph</I> argument to <B>pfNode::setBound</B> is the bound-
       ing sphere of the pfNode.  If the <I>bsph</I> is <B>NULL</B>,
       OpenGL Performer will compute the bounding sphere
       of the pfNode.

       The <I>mode</I> argument to <B>pfNode::setBound</B> specifies
       whether or not the bounding volume for the pfNode
       should be recomputed when an attribute of the pfN-
       changes.  Changes in pfSwitches, pfLODs and pfSe-
       quences do not affect bounds above them in the
       scene graph.

       <B>pfNode::getBound</B> returns the current bounding mode
       and copies into <I>bsph</I> a pfSphere which encloses the
       pfNode and its children The return value is the
       bounding mode which is either <B>PFBOUND_DYNAMIC</B> or
       <B>PFBOUND_STATIC</B> indicating whether or not the bound-
       ing volume is updated automatically when its chil-
       dren change.

       OpenGL Performer supports two methods of node
       instancing.  The first method is to simply add a
       node to more than one parent using
       <B>pfGroup::addChild</B> or <B>pfGroup::replaceChild</B> (see
       pfGroup).  In this case the graph rooted by the
       instanced node is shared by all its parents.  This
       type of instancing is called <I>shared</I> instancing.

       <B>pfNode::clone</B> provides instancing which shares
       geometry but not variable state like transforma-
       tions (pfDCS) and switches (pfSwitch).
       <B>pfNode::clone</B> copies the entire scene graph from
       the pfNode down to, but not including, leaf geome-
       try nodes such as pfGeodes, pfBillboards and
       pfLightPoints.  These leaf nodes are instanced by
       reference in the cloned scene graph.  <B>pfNode::clone</B>
       returns the root pfNode of the cloned graph or <B>NULL</B>
       to indicate error.  This type of instancing is
       called <I>common</I> <I>geometry</I> instancing.  An attempt to
       clone a leaf geometry node simply returns the han-
       dle to that node.

       Cloning is recommended for instances of dynamic and
       articulated models.  For example: Shared instances
       of a model with pfDCSes in its hierarchy will share
       the pfDCSes as well as the geometry.  This means
       that all instances will have the exact same articu-
       lation.  However, a common geometry instance will
       share only geometry and as a result of the cloning
       process will have its own pfDCSes allowing manipu-
       lation independently of any other instances.  This
       example creates a cloned instance:

       if ((clone = carModel-&gt;<B>clone(0)</B>) != NULL)
           carDCS_3-&gt;addChild(clone);


       The <I>mode</I> argument to <B>pfNode::clone</B> is reserved for
       future extensions and must be 0 in this release of
       OpenGL Performer.

       When cloning, if the global copy function (-
       <B>pfObject::setCopyFunc</B>) is <B>NULL</B>, user data pointers
       (<B>pfObject::setUserData</B>) are copied to each new node
       and the reference counts of pfMemory-derived user
       data are incremented. If <B>pfObject::setCopyFunc</B> is
       not <B>NULL</B>, it will be invoked with the destination
       subtree. The clone of the pfNode and its subtree is
       placed in the current buffer set by
       <B>pfBuffer::select</B>. See the pfBuffer man page for
       more details.

       <B>pfNode::flatten</B> is a database pre-processing step
       which 'flattens' the transformation hierarchy of
       the scene graph rooted by the pfNode.  Coordinates
       and normals contained in leaf geometry nodes such
       as pfGeodes, pfBillboards and pfLightPoints are
       transformed by any inherited static transformations
       (pfSCS).  <B>pfNode::flatten</B> automatically clones any
       pfNode or pfGeoSet that is multiply referenced.
       Specifically, if the pfNode has multiple parents,
       <I>node</I> and its entire subtree will be cloned. If a
       pfDCS is encountered, <B>pfNode::flatten</B> inserts a
       pfSCS in between the pfDCS and its parent.

       Flattening can substantially improve performance,
       especially when pfSCSes are being used to instance
       a relatively small amount of geometry since the
       cost of the transformation approaches the cost of
       drawing the geometry.  However, it can also
       increase the size of the database since it copies
       instanced nodes and geometry.  Flattening is highly
       recommended for pfBillboards. Flattening also
       increases the ability of OpenGL Performer to sort
       the database by mode (see <B>pfChannel::setBinSort</B>),
       often a major performance enhancement, since sort-
       ing does not cross transformation boundaries.

       <B>pfNode::flatten</B> does not remove pfSCSes from the
       hierarchy; instead it sets their transformations to
       the identity matrix.  For improved traversal per-
       formance, these flattened pfSCS nodes should be
       removed from the hierarchy.

       The <I>mode</I> argument to pfFlatten is currently ignored
       and should be 0.

       All OpenGL Performer database nodes may be assigned
       a character string name.  Individual node names
       need not be unique but to access a node with a non-
       unique name, an unambiguous pathname to the node
       must be given.  The pathname doesn't need to be a
       full path.  All that's required is enough to dis-
       tinguish the node from others with the same name.

       <B>pfNode::setName</B> sets the name of the pfNode to the
       string <I>name</I>.  If the name is unique a 1 will be
       returned and if the name is not unique, a 0 will be
       returned. Node names are kept in a global table
       which is used for resolving the first path compo-
       nent of a path name by <B>pfNode::lookup</B>. In this
       case, unambiguous resolution is only possible if
       the first path component is unique. <B>pfNode::getName</B>
       returns the name of the node or NULL if the name
       has not been set.

       <B>pfNode::find</B> is equivalent to <B>pfMemory::isOfType</B>,
       not <B>pfMemory::isExactType</B>, e.g. searching for a
       pfGroup includes derived classes such as pfSwitch.

       The string <I>pathName</I> can be either a name or a
       '/'-separated pathname.  If the name contains no
       '/' characters, it is assumed to be unique and the
       global name table is searched.  If <I>pathName</I> con-
       tains '/' characters, it is assumed to be a path.
       Paths are searched by first finding the node corre-
       sponding to the first component of the path in a
       global name table. The find routine then traverses
       the subtree rooted at that node, searching for the
       rest of the path. The first node encountered during
       the search traversal which matches <I>pathName</I> is
       returned.

       Example 1:


       pfNode    *newhouse, *newdoor;
       pfDCS     *door;

       /* Create "house" model with named subparts including "door" */

       /* Create a new instance of "house" */
       newhouse = house-&gt;<B>clone(0)</B>;

       /* Give cloned house a new name */
       newhouse-&gt;setName("newhouse");

       /* Find the door part of the new house */
       door = (pfDCS*) newhouse-&gt;find("door", pfDCS::getClassType());


       <B>pfNode::isect</B> intersects a group of line segments
       with a scene or portion thereof.  The intersection
       operation traverses the scene graph, testing a
       group of segments against bounding geometry and
       eventually model geometry within pfGeoSets.

       <B>pfNode::isect</B> returns the number of segments which
       intersected something.  <I>hits</I> is an empty array sup-
       plied by the user through which results are
       returned.  The array must have an entry for each
       segment in <I>segSet</I>.  Upon return, <I>hits</I>[i][0] is a
       pfHit* which gives the intersection result for the
       <I>i</I>th segment in <I>segSet</I>.  The pfHit objects come from
       an internally maintained pool and are reused on
       subsequent requests.  Hence, the contents are only
       valid until the next invocation of <B>pfGSetIsectSegs</B>
       in the current process.  They should not be freed
       by the application.

       <I>segSet</I> is a pfSegSet structure specifying the
       intersection request.  In the structure, <I>segs</I> is an
       array of line segments to be intersected against
       the pfGeoSet.  <I>activeMask</I> is a bit vector specify-
       ing which segments in the pfSegSet are to be active

              <B>PFTRAV_IS_PRIM</B>
                   Intersect with quads or triangle geome-
                   try.

              <B>PFTRAV_IS_GSET</B>
                   Intersect with pfGeoSet bounding boxes.

              <B>PFTRAV_IS_GEODE</B>
                   Intersect with pfGeode bounding sphere.

              <B>PFTRAV_IS_NORM</B>
                   Return normals in the pfHit structure.

              <B>PFTRAV_IS_CULL_BACK</B>
                   Ignore back-facing polygons.

              <B>PFTRAV_IS_CULL_FRONT</B>
                   Ignore front-facing polygons.

              <B>PFTRAV_IS_PATH</B>
                   Retain traversal path information.

              <B>PFTRAV_IS_NO_PART</B>
                   Do not use partitions for intersec-
                   tions.

       For several types of pfGroups, the traversal of
       children can be controlled for the traversal.

       For pfSwitches, the default is to traverse only the
       child or children specified by the current switch
       value.  This can be changed OR-ing one of the fol-
       lowing into the <I>mode</I> argument.

              <B>PFTRAV_SW_ALL</B>
                   Traverse all children of pfSwitches.

              <B>PFTRAV_SW_NONE</B>
                   Don't traverse any children of
                   pfSwitches.

       For pfSequences, the default is to traverse only
       the current child in the sequence.  This can be
       changed OR-ing one of the following into the <I>mode</I>
       argument.
              <B>PFTRAV_SEQ_ALL</B> Intersect with all children
              of pfSequences.

              <B>PFTRAV_SEQ_NONE</B>
                     Intersect with no children of pfSe-

       For pfLODs, the default is to traverse only the
       child that would be active at range 0.  This can be
       changed OR-ing one of the following into the <I>mode</I>
       argument.  Also, see <B>pfChannel::isect</B> for child
       selection based on range.
              <B>PFTRAV_LOD_ALL</B> Intersect with all children

       children.  This can be changed OR-ing one of the
       following into the <I>mode</I> argument.
              <B>PFTRAV_LAYER_NONE</B> Intersect with no children
              of pfLayers (default is all).

              <B>PFTRAV_LAYER_BASE</B>
                     Intersect with no children of pfLay-
                     ers (default is all).

              <B>PFTRAV_LAYER_DECAL</B>
                     Intersect with no children of pfLay-
                     ers (default is all).

       The bit fields <B>PFTRAV_IS_PRIM</B>, <B>PFTRAV_IS_GSET</B>, and
       <B>PFTRAV_IS_GEODE</B> indicate the level at which inter-
       sections should be evaluated and discriminator
       callbacks, if any, invoked.  If none of these three
       fields are specified, no intersection testing is
       done.

       In the pfSegSet, <I>isectMask</I> is another bit vector
       which directs the intersection traversal.  At each
       stage of the intersection operation, the mask is
       bit-wise AND-ed with the mask of the pfNode or
       pfGeoSet.  If the mask is non-zero the intersection
       continues with the next object, either a pfNode
       within a pfGroup or a primitive within a pfGeoSet.
       The mask of a pfNode is set using
       <B>pfNode::setTravMask</B> and that of a pfGeoSet by
       <B>pfGeoSet::setIsectMask</B>.  The mask can be used to
       distinguish parts of the scene graph which might
       respond differently to vision or collision.  For
       example, as a wall would stop a truck but shrubbery
       would not.

       The <I>bound</I> field in a pfSegSet is an optional user-
       provided bounding volume around the set of seg-
       ments.  Currently, the only supported volume is a
       cylinder.  To use a bounding cylinder, perform a
       bitwise OR of <B>PFTRAV_IS_BCYL</B> into the <B>mode</B> field of
       the pfSegSet and assign the pointer to the bounding
       volume to the <B>bound</B> field.

       <B>pfCylinder::around</B> will construct a cylinder around
       the segments.  When a bounding volume is supplied,
       the intersection traversal may use the cylinder to
       improve performance.  The largest improvement is
       for groups of at least several segments which are
       closely grouped segments.  Placing a bounding
       cylinder around small groups or widely dispersed
       segments can decrease performance.

       The <I>userData</I> pointer allows an application to asso-
       ciate other data with the pfSegSet.  Upon return
       and in discriminator callbacks, the pfSegSet's
       <I>userData</I> pointer can be obtained from the returned
       pfHit with <B>pfObject::getUserData</B>.

       <I>discFunc</I> is a user supplied callback function which
       specified in <I>mode</I>.  Thus, the segment is clipped by
       each successful intersection so that the intersec-
       tion point nearest the starting point of the seg-
       ment is returned upon completion.

       If a discriminator callback is specified, whenever
       an intersection occurs, the <I>discFunc</I> callback is
       invoked with a pfHit structure containing informa-
       tion about the intersection.  The discriminator may
       then return a value which indicates whether and how
       the intersection should continue. The continuation
       selectors are <B>PFTRAV_CONT</B>, <B>PFTRAV_PRUNE</B>, and
       <B>PFTRAV_TERM</B>.

              <B>PFTRAV_CONT</B>
                   Indicates that the traversal should
                   continue traversing the pfGeoSets
                   beneath a pfGeode.  The discriminator
                   function can examine information about
                   candidate intersections and judge their
                   validity and control the continuation
                   of the traversal with its return value.

              <B>PFTRAV_PRUNE</B>
                   Indicates the traversal should return
                   from the current level of the search
                   and continue.  If returned on a
                   pfGeoSet primitive or bounding box
                   test, <B>PFTRAV_PRUNE</B> stops further test-
                   ing of the line segment against that
                   pfGeoSet.  If returned on the test
                   against a pfGeode bounding volume, the
                   pfGeode is not traversed for that line
                   segment.

              <B>PFTRAV_TERM</B>
                   Indicates that the search should termi-
                   nate for this segment of the pfSegSet.
                   To have <B>PFTRAV_TERM</B> or <B>PFTRAV_PRUNE</B>
                   apply to all segments,
                   <B>PFTRAV_IS_ALL_SEGS</B> can be OR-ed into
                   the discriminator return value.  This
                   causes the entire traversal to be ter-
                   minated or pruned.

       The callback may OR other bitfields into the status
       return value:

              <B>PFTRAV_IS_IGNORE</B>
                   Indicates that the current intersection
                   should be ignored, otherwise the inter-
                   section is taken as valid.

              <B>PFTRAV_IS_CLIP_START</B>
                   Indicates for pruned and continued
                   traversals that before proceeding the
                   segment should be clipped to start at
                   the current intersection point.

       the discriminator returned <B>PFTRAV_CONT</B> |
       <B>PFTRAV_IS_CLIP_END</B>, so that the intersection near-
       est the start of the segment will be returned.

       In addition to the discriminator callback, pre- and
       post- intersection callbacks are available for each
       node.  These behave identically to the pre- and
       post-callbacks for the cull traversal and can be
       used to prune, continue or terminate the traversal
       at any node.

       Both <B>pfNode::isect</B> and the discriminator callback
       return information about an intersection in a pfHit
       object which can be examined using the <B>pfHit::query</B>
       and <B>pfHit::mQuery</B> <B>calls</B>.  The information includes
       the intersection point, current matrix transforma-
       tion, scene graph, and path.  See the man page for
       pfHit for further details.

       In multiprocess applications, <B>pfNode::isect</B> should
       be called from the APP process or from the ISECT
       process (in the callback specified by <B>pfIsectFunc</B>).
       When called in the APP process, <B>pfNode::isect</B>
       should be called after <B>pfFrame</B> and before <B>pfSync</B>
       for best system throughput.

       <B>pfNode::setTravMask</B> sets the traversal masks of
       <I>node</I> which are used to control traversal during the
       intersection, cull, and draw traversals.  If the
       bitwise AND of the node's mask for that traversal
       type and the mask for the current traversal is
       zero, the traversal is disabled at that node.  By
       default, the node masks are all 1's.  Traverser
       masks are set by <B>pfNode::isect</B>/<B>pfChanNodeIsectSegs</B>
       for the intersection traversal and
       <B>pfChannel::setTravMask</B> for the CULL and DRAW
       traversals.  <B>pfNode::getTravMask</B> returns the speci-
       fied traversal mask for the node.

       Bits in the <I>setMode</I> argument indicate whether the
       set operation should be carried out for just the
       specified pfNode (<B>PFTRAV_SELF</B>), just its descen-
       dents (<B>PFTRAV_DESCEND</B>) or both itself and descen-
       dents.  The descendent traversal goes down into
       pfGeoSets.

       The <I>bitOp</I> argument is one of <B>PF_AND</B>, <B>PF_OR</B>, or
       <B>PF_SET</B> and indicates whether the new mask should be
       AND-ed with the old mask, OR-ed with the old mask
       or set outright, respectively.

       Efficient intersections require that information be
       cached for each pfGeoSet to be intersected with.
       To create this cache, <B>PFTRAV_IS_CACHE</B> should be OR-
       ed into the <I>setMode</I> when first setting the inter-
       section mask.  Because of the computation involved,
       the cache is best created at setup time.  Subse-
       quent changes to the masks themselves do not
       require <B>PFTRAV_IS_CACHE</B> to be specified.  However,
       is <B>PFTRAV_ISECT</B>.

       <B>pfNode::setTravFuncs</B> specify the user supplied
       functions which are to be invoked during the
       traversal indicated by <I>which</I>.  For each traversal,
       there is a <I>pre</I> and <I>post</I> traversal callback.  <I>pre</I> is
       invoked before <I>node</I> and its children are processed
       while <I>post</I> is invoked after.  The pre- and post-
       methodology supports save and restore or push and
       pop programming constructs.  Node callbacks are
       passed pointers to the user supplied traversal data
       pointer for that node and a pfTraverser which
       defines the current traversal state.
       <B>pfNode::getTravFuncs</B> copies the pfNode's pre and
       post callbacks of traversal type <I>which</I> into <I>pre</I> and
       <I>post</I> respectively.

       The <I>data</I> argument to <B>pfNode::setTravData</B> is the
       pointer which is passed to the traversal callbacks
       indicated by <I>which</I>.  Both pre- and post-callbacks
       will be passed <I>data</I> in addition to a pfTraverser*.
       When multiprocessing, <I>data</I> should point to memory
       in a shared arena.  <B>pfNode::getTravData</B> returns the
       current data pointer for the specified traversal.

       <B>setTravMode</B> is used to set additional mode informa-
       tion to control traversals.  Currently the <B>which</B>
       argument must be <B>PFTRAV_CONT</B> and the <B>mode</B> argument
       must be <B>PFN_CULL_SORT</B>; the possible choices for the
       <B>value</B> argument are:

              <B>PFN_CULL_SORT_UNCONTAINED</B>
                   This is the default value.  It means
                   that pre- and post-CULL traversal funcs
                   on a node do not prevent the contents
                   of the node from being interleaved with
                   the contents of other nodes during CULL
                   sorting.  This means that (surprise!)
                   the contents of the node are not neces-
                   sarily bracketed by the graphics calls
                   made in the pre- and post-CULL node
                   trav funcs.  This behavior is for the
                   benefit of CULL funcs whose purpose is
                   to return a cull result but that don't
                   make any graphics calls.  (Note that in
                   contrast, pre- and post-DRAW funcs on a
                   node are guaranteed to bracket the con-
                   tents of the node, and therefore they
                   prevent the interleaving of the con-
                   tents of the node with the contents of
                   other nodes.)

              <B>PFN_CULL_SORT_CONTAINED</B>
                   This is the opposite of
                   <B>PFN_CULL_SORT_UNCONTAINED</B>; setting this
                   value guarantees the following:
                   1. Display list items produced by the
                   pre-node CULL func will get placed in
                   the display list before the contents of
                   3. No part of the scene graph other
                   than this node (including its children
                   and DRAW funcs) will be placed in the
                   display list between the items produced
                   by the pre-node CULL func and the items
                   produced by the post-node CULL func.
                   <B>PFN_CULL_SORT_CONTAINED</B> is typically
                   used in applications such as virtual
                   clip texturing in which the pre-cull
                   function calls display-listable func-
                   tions (such as
                   <B>pfClipTexture::applyVirtualParams</B>)
                   which are intended to affect the con-
                   tents of the node and its children, and
                   no other part of the scene graph.
                   Turning off CULL sorting altogether
                   using <B>pfChannel::setTravMode</B> is another
                   way to accomplish this effect, but that
                   is usually overkill and can result in
                   greatly decreased performance, as can
                   setting DRAW trav funcs on the node to
                   accomplish the <B>PFN_CULL_SORT_CONTAINED</B>
                   effect.

       <B>getTravMode</B> returns the current value of the given
       <B>mode</B> for the given traversal type <B>which</B>.

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       When instanced geometry is flattened, the copy cre-
       ated by <B>pfNode::flatten</B> shares pfGeoSet attribute
       arrays with the original when possible.  This means
       that the newly flattened pfGeoSet may share some
       arrays (e.g. color array), but not other arrays
       (e.g. the vertex array) with the original.

       The post-cull callback is a good place to implement
       custom level-of-detail mechanisms.

       Currently, nodes use spheres as the default bound-
       ing volume.  This may change in a future release.
       <B>libpfutil</B> contains sample code for computing the
       bounding box for a subgraph of the scene.

       It's an interesting fact that although a node's
       bounding volume completely contains the geometry of
       the nodes that it parents, it may well <I>not</I> com-
       pletely contain the bounding volumes of those same
       nodes.  Do you understand when this situation would
       occur?

       Finding a node by name can be expensive, particu-
       larly for path based searches.  These functions are
       primarily intended to get handles to nodes which
       are loaded from disk and should be used sparingly
       at simulation time.

       In OpenGL Performer releases since 2.0,
       <B>pfNode::lookup</B> replaces a number of functions from
       (i.e. a node having two or more parents within the
       graph), the new graph will contain multiple copies
       of the instanced node rather than duplicating the
       connectivity of the original graph.

       <B>pfNode::flatten</B> transforms the vertex arrays of
       non-instanced geometry in place.  If a pfGeoSet
       belongs to multiple pfGeodes or a vertex array is
       shared between pfGeoSets the array is still flat-
       tened in place.

       It is not possible to get multiple intersection
       results per segment without a discriminator call-
       back.

       Bounding cylinders do not work when non-orthonormal
       transformations are present in the pfDCS and pfSCS
       nodes of a scene graph.

       The path returned by <B>pfGetTravPath</B> is valid only
       when invoked from a cull callback.
