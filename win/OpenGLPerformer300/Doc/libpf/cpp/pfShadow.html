<H2>PARENT CLASS FUNCTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The  OpenGL  Performer  class <B>pfShadow</B> is derived from the
       parent class <B>pfObject</B>, so each of these  member  functions
       of class <B>pfObject</B> are also directly usable with objects of
       class <B>pfShadow</B>.  This is also true for ancestor classes of
       class <B>pfObject</B>.

       void*   <B>pfObject::operator</B> <B>new</B>(size_t);
       void*   <B>pfObject::operator</B> <B>new</B>(size_t, void *arena);
       void*   <B>pfObject::operator</B>      <B>new</B>(size_t,     pfFluxMem-
                 ory *fmem);
       void    <B>pfObject::setUserData</B>(void *data);
       void    <B>pfObject::setUserData</B>(int slot, void *data);
       void*   <B>pfObject::getUserData</B>(pfObject *obj);
       void*   <B>pfObject::getUserData</B>(pfObject *obj, int slot);
       int     <B>pfObject::getNumUserData</B>();


       Since the class <B>pfObject</B> is itself derived from the parent
       class <B>pfMemory</B>, objects of class <B>pfShadow</B> can also be used
       with  these  functions  designed  for  objects  of   class
       <B>pfMemory</B>.

       void*          <B>pfMemory::getData</B>(const void *ptr);
       pfType *       <B>pfMemory::getType</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::isOfType</B>(pfType *type);
       int            <B>pfMemory::isExactType</B>(pfType *type);
       const char *   <B>pfMemory::getTypeName</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::copy</B>(pfMemory *src);
       int            <B>pfMemory::compare</B>(const pfMemory *mem);

                        char *prefix, FILE *file);
       int            <B>pfMemory::getArena</B>(void *ptr);

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A pfShadow is used to control rendering of  shadows  under
       selected  objects.  The  user can specify a set of objects
       and a set of light sources.   The  class  takes  over  the
       drawing  and  renders  shadows  for  each combination of a
       shadow caster and a light source. Shadows are rendered  by
       projecting  the objects as seen from the light source into
       a texture and projecting the  texture  onto  a  scene.  To
       avoid  computing the texture for each frame, a set of tex-
       tures is precomputed at the first  frame,  then  for  each
       frame  the  best  representative  is  chosen and warped to
       specified by a scene graph node and a matrix that contains
       the transformation of the node with respect to  the  scene
       graph root.  Shadow casters are indexed from 0 to the num-
       ber of casters minus 1.  Similarly, the  number  of  light
       sources  is  set  by  function <B>pfShadow::setNumSources</B>.  A
       light source is defined by its position or direction,  set
       by   <B>pfShadow::setSourcePos</B>  or  <B>pfShadow::setLight</B>.   The
       class   initialization    is    completed    by    calling
       <B>pfShadow::apply</B>.

       A  pfShadow  needs information about the current eye posi-
       tion and view direction.  Since this  information  is  not
       directly  accessible  in a draw process it is necessary to
       call <B>pfShadow::addChannel</B> for each channel (at the  begin-
       ning  of  the application).  Whenever the view changes the
       application  process  has  to  call  <B>pfShadow::updateView</B>.
       Even  if the view does not change, this function has to be
       called at least once in a single process mode or  as  many
       times  as  the  number  of buffers in a pfFlux in MP mode.
       Without updating the view the shadow is not rendered  cor-
       rectly.

       Example:

       pfShadow *shd = new pfShadow;

       shd-&gt;<B>setNumCasters(2)</B>;
       shd-&gt;setShadowCaster(0, node1, matrix1);
       shd-&gt;setShadowCaster(1, node2, matrix2);

       shd-&gt;<B>setNumSources(1)</B>;
       shd-&gt;setSourcePos(0, x1, y1, z1, w1);

       shd-&gt;addChannel(channel);

       shd-&gt;apply();


       See a sample implementation of shadows in perf/sam-
       ples/pguide/libpf/C++/shadowsNew.


       ADDITIONAL PARAMETERS

       As the caster is projected into a shadow texture the cen-
       ter of the projection corresponds with the center of the
       bounding box of the caster's node. When the shadow texture
       is skewed to approximate shadows from slightly different
       direction its is best if the center of the projection cor-
       responds with the center of the object. The bounding box
       center may not coincide with the center of the object (in
       case of some long protruding parts) and function
       <B>pfShadow::adjustCasterCenter</B> can be used to shift the
       bounding box center towards the object center.

       The shadow texture is used to darken the scene pixels when
       the texture texel is set to 1. The amount by which the
       scene pixel is darkened can be set by
       <B>pfShadow::setAmbientFactor</B>.  The default value is 0.6
       PFSHD_PARAM_NUM_TEXTURES.  The set of directions can be
       controlled by getting the pointer to the corresponding
       pfDirData (a class that stores data associated with a set
       of directions), using <B>pfShadow::getDirData</B>.  Then you can
       either select the default mode (see below) or specify the
       directions directly. See class pfDirData for more details.
       By default there is one texture of size 512x512 and the
       direction corresponds to the light direction (or a vector
       from a point light source to the object center). If there
       are more textures, the original light direction is rotated
       around a horizontal direction, assuming that the object
       will mostly keep its horizontal position (for example a
       helicopter or a plane).


       RENDERING

       The user has to call the draw function provided by the
       class <B>pfShadow::draw</B> otherwise shadows are not rendered.
       Before the first frame is rendered all required shadow
       textures are precomputed. A warning is printed if the win-
       dow size is smaller than the texture dimensions. Make sure
       that the window is not obscured, otherwise the textures
       would not be correct.

       By default only the closest shadow texture is selected for
       any direction and it is skewed so that it approximates the
       correct shadow. Optionally, a flag PFSHD_BLEND_TEXTURES
       can be set using <B>pfShadow::setFlags</B>. In this case two
       closest textures are selected and blended together,
       resulting in smoother transitions.  Also, instead of a
       linear blend between the textures, the user can define a
       blend function, mapping values 0-1 to interval 0-1. The
       blend function can be set using
       <B>pfShadow::setTextureBlendFunc</B>.

       Every time the caster changes its position or orientation
       with respect to the light source, it is necessary to
       update its matrix using <B>pfShadow::updateCaster</B> (the caster
       is identified by its index).  When the caster's matrix
       changes the shadow of the caster changes as well.  In this
       case, the set of precomputed shadow textures is searched
       to find one or two closest representatives.

       A visual with an alpha channel has to be selected for the
       rendering to work.  See sample code in perf/sam-
       ples/pguide/libpf/C++/shadowsNew.C for an example of how
       to get a visual with an alpha channel.

       LIMITATIONS

       Since pfShadow is using its own draw function you cannot
       use it together with pfVolFog.

       pfShadow is using cull programs to cull out geometry that
       is not affected by the shadow to make the multi-pass draw-
       ing more efficient. At present, though, the cull program
       used by pfShadow class overwrites any other cull program
       specified by the user. Note: make sure that you do not
       ignored, which can be useful in case of helicopter rotors,
       for example.
