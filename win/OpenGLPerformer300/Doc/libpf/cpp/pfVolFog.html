<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A  pfVolFog is a class that is used to draw the scene with
       fog that has different densities at different locations in
       the scene. The class supports two types of nonuniform fog:
       a layered fog and a patchy fog.

       A layered fog changes only with elevation, its density and
       color  is  uniform at a given height. In a pfVolFog a lay-
       ered fog is defined by a set  of  elevation  points.  Each
       elevation  point  can specify a fog density and optionally
       also a fog color at the point's  elevation.   The  density
       and  the  color between two neighboring points is linearly
       interpolated.  A patchy fog is defined  by  closed  three-
       dimensional  objects  and  its  density is constant inside
       these objects. At the moment all objects specify a  patchy
       fog of the same color and the same density.

       A  pfVolFog  is not part of the scene graph, it is created
       separately by the application process. Once created eleva-
       tion  points  of a layered fog can be specified by calling
       <B>pfVolFog::addPoint</B>  or  <B>pfVolFog::addColoredPoint</B>  repeat-
       edly.   The  fog  initialization  is  completed by calling
       <B>pfVolFog::apply</B>.

       Example:

       pfVolFog *lfog = new pfVolFog;

       lfog-&gt;addPoint(elev1, density1);
       lfog-&gt;addPoint(elev2, density2);
       enclosing the foggy areas. It is possible to define sev-
       eral disjoint areas in the same tree or by adding several
       different nodes.  Note that each area has to be completely
       enclosed and the vertices of the surfaces have to be
       ordered so that the front face of each surface faces out-
       side the foggy area. The node has to be part of the scene
       graph for the rendering to work properly.

       Example:

       pfVolFog *pfog = new pfVolFog;

       pfog-&gt;addNode(fogNode);

       pfog-&gt;apply();


       Patchy and layered fog can be combined but only if layered
       fog has a uniform color.


       The function <B>pfVolFog::apply</B> initializes a pfVolFog. If at
       least two elevation points were defined it initializes
       data structures necessary for rendering of a layered fog,
       including a 3D texture.  Any control points defined after-
       wards are ignored.  If a node containing patchy fog bound-
       aries has been added prior to calling <B>pfVolFog::apply</B> a
       patchy fog is initialized.  Since function
       <B>pfVolFog::addNode</B> only marks the parts of the scene graphs
       that specify the texture it is possible to add additional
       patchy fog nodes even after <B>pfVolFog::apply</B> has been
       called.


       A pfVolFog needs information about the current eye posi-
       tion and view direction.  Since this information is not
       directly accessible in a draw process it is necessary to
       call <B>pfVolFog::addChannel</B> for each channel (at the begin-
       ning of the application).  Whenever the view changes the
       application process has to call <B>pfVolFog::updateView</B>. For
       example, see programs in perf/samples/apps/C/fogfly or
       perf/samples/apps/C++/volfog.  Without updating the view
       the fog will not be rendered.

       If the application changes the position of the patchy fog
       boundaries (for example, by inserting a pfSCS, pfDCS, or
       pfFCS node above the fog node) or the orientation of the
       whole scene with respect to the up vector (for example,
       the use of a trackball in perfly) the fog may not be drawn
       correctly.


       To draw the scene with a fog the draw process has to call
       <B>pfVolFog::draw</B> instead of <B>pfDraw</B>. This function will take
       care of drawing the whole scene graph with the specified
       fog. Expect the draw time to increase because the scene is
       drawn twice (three times if both patchy and layered fog
       are specified). In case of a patchy fog there may also be
       several full-screen polygons being drawn.  You can easily
       (optimally 12-bit per r,g,b) and a stencil buffer. It is
       recommended to use at least a 4-bit stencil buffer (1-bit
       is sufficient only for very simple fog objects).  It may
       be necessary to modify your application so that it asks
       for such a visual.

       A pfVolFog can be deleted using <B>pfDelete</B>. In case of a
       layered fog it is necessary to delete the texture handle
       in a draw process. The texture is returned by
       <B>pfVolFog::getTexture</B>.  See example in perf/sam-
       ples/apps/C/fogfly.


       FOG PARAMETERS

       As mentioned above a layered fog of a uniform color is
       specified by function <B>pfVolFog::addPoint</B>, which sets the
       fog density at a given elevation.  The density is scaled
       so that if the fog has density 1 the nearest object inside
       the fog that has full fog color is at a distance equal to
       the 1/10 of the diagonal of the scene bounding box.  The
       layered fog color is set by function <B>pfVolFog::setColor</B> or
       by calling <B>pfVolFog::setAttr</B> with parameter PFVFOG_COLOR
       and a pointer to an array of three floats. The default fog
       color is (0.9,0.9,1).

       A layered fog of a nonuniform color is specified by func-
       tion <B>pfVolFog::addColoredPoint</B>, which sets the fog density
       and the fog color at a given elevation. The color set by
       <B>pfVolFog::setColor</B> is then ignored.

       The layered fog mode is set by function <B>pfVolFog::setVal</B>
       with parameter PFVFOG_LAYERED_MODE and one of PFVFOG_LIN-
       EAR, PFVFOG_EXP, or PFVFOG_EXP2. It is also possible to
       set the mode both for a layered and patchy fog at once by
       using parameter PFVFOG_MODE.  The default mode is PFV-
       FOG_LINEAR. Function of the mode parameter is equivalent
       to function of the fog mode of the OpenGL <B>glFog()</B>.

       A layered fog can be self-shadowed, that is the lower
       parts of a dense fog appear darker. Self-shadowing is
       enabled by setting flag PFVFOG_FLAG_SELF_SHADOWING to 1.
       The fog mode should be set to PFVFOG_EXP.  When the fog is
       has different colors at different elevations a secondary
       scattering is approximated, when the flag PFV-
       FOG_FLAG_FOG_FILTER is set to 1.  In this case the color
       of a higher layer may affect the color of a lower layer.
       If the flag PFVFOG_FLAG_DARKEN_OBJECTS is set even the
       objects below a dense fog become darker. The light is
       assumed to come from the top.

       The size of a 3D texture used by a layer fog can be modi-
       fied by calling <B>pfVolFog::setAttr</B> with parameter PFV-
       FOG_3D_TEX_SIZE and an array of three integer values. The
       default texture size is 64x64x64, but reasonable results
       can be achieved with even smaller sizes. The sizes are
       automatically rounded to the closest greater or equal
       power of 2. The second value should be greater or equal
       than the third value.
       be forced by calling <B>pfVolFog::setFlags</B> with flag PFV-
       FOG_FLAG_FORCE_2D_TEXTURE set to 1.

       Once a layered fog is initialized by calling the
       <B>pfVolFog::apply</B> changing any of the above parameters will
       not affect rendering of the layered fog.


       The density of a patchy fog is controlled by function
       <B>pfVolFog::setDensity</B>. It can be also set using
       <B>pfVolFog::setVal</B> with parameter PFVFOG_FOG_DENSITY.  As in
       case of a layered fog the density of a patchy fog is
       scaled by the tenth of the diagonal of the scene bounding
       box.


       The user can specify an additional density value that is
       added to every pixel inside or behind a patchy fog bound-
       ary using the function <B>pfVolFog::setVal</B> with parameter
       PFVFOG_FOG_DENSITY_BIAS. This value makes a patchy fog
       appear denser but it may create unrealistically sharp
       boundaries. The default value is 0.

       The patchy fog color is set by function <B>pfVolFog::setColor</B>
       or by calling <B>pfVolFog::setAttr</B> with parameter PFV-
       FOG_COLOR and a pointer to an array of three floats.  If
       the blend_color extension is not available patchy fog will
       be white.

       The patchy fog mode is set by function <B>pfVolFog::setVal</B>
       with parameter PFVFOG_PATCHY_MODE and one of PFVFOG_LIN-
       EAR, PFVFOG_EXP, or PFVFOG_EXP2. It is also possible to
       set the mode both for a patchy and layered fog at once by
       using parameter PFVFOG_MODE.  The default mode is PFV-
       FOG_LINEAR.

       The quality and speed of patchy fog rendering can be con-
       trolled by <B>pfVolFog::setVal</B> with parameter PFVFOG_RESOLU-
       TION. The resolution is a value between 0 and 1. Higher
       values will reduce banding and speed up the drawing.  On
       the other hand, high values may cause corruption in areas
       of too many overlapping fog surfaces. The default value is
       0.2, but you may try to use values higher than that if
       your fog boundaries do not overlap much.

       Parameters of a patchy fog can be modified any time and
       they will affect the rendering of the subsequent frame. A
       patchy fog can also be animated by modifying the geometry
       of the fog nodes. Make sure that the bounding box of the
       geoset is updated and that <B>pfVolFog::addNode</B> is called
       every time the bounding box is updated.

       The multi-pass algorithms used for rendering layered and
       patchy fog may produce incorrect results if the scene
       graph contains polygons that have equal depth values. To
       avoid such problems a stencil buffer is used during ren-
       dering of the second pass. You can disable this function
       by setting flag PFVFOG_FLAG_CLOSE_SURFACES to 0.


       It is possible to use a different algorithm for rendering
       patchy fog that can handle semitransparent surfaces bet-
       ter. To use this algorithm, set flag PFV-
       FOG_FASTER_PATCHY_FOG to 1.

       The faster algorithm also allows the color of patchy fog
       to be modified using a texture. Either a predefined 1D
       texture expressing the attenuation between two elevations
       is used or the user provides a 1D or a 3D texture for each
       volume object. The predefined 1D texture is enabled by
       setting flag PFVFOG_FLAG_PATCHY_FOG_1DTEXTURE. The texture
       is mapped to the range of elevations between the bottom
       and top of the fog bounding box. The texture value at the
       bottom (default 0.3) can be modified by calling
       <B>pfVolFog::setVal</B> with parameter PFVFOG_PATCHY_TEXTURE_BOT-
       TOM and the value at the top (default 1.5) using parameter
       PFVFOG_PATCHY_TEXTURE_TOP.  To be able to use a different
       scale for objects of different sizes, the fog objects have
       to be specified separately. When flag PFVFOG_FLAG_SEPA-
       RATE_NODE_BINS is set all calls to <B>pfVolFog::addNode</B>
       define fog nodes that are drawn separately and the prede-
       fined texture is scaled according to the bounding box of
       each node.  If both flag PFVFOG_FLAG_PATCHY_FOG_1DTEXTURE
       and flag PFVFOG_FLAG_USER_PATCHY_FOG_TEXTURE are set tex-
       tures associated with the fog nodes are used to modify the
       surface color of a patchy fog (also only in the faster
       algorithm).  To avoid artifacts on overlapping colored
       patchy fog objects a flag PFVFOG_FLAG_DRAW_NODES_SEPA-
       RATELY forces the algorithm to be applied to each node
       separately, in the back-to-front order with respect to the
       viewpoint. Currently, this mode does not work well when
       scene objects intersect fog objects.

       If flag PFVFOG_FLAG_LAYERED_PATCHY_FOG is set the layered
       fog is used to define the density and possibly also the
       color of a patchy fog.  The layered fog is then present
       only in areas defined by the patchy fog boundaries. Since
       layered fog is computed for the whole scene, it is impor-
       tant to set fog parameter PFVFOG_MAX_DISTANCE to a value
       that corresponds to the size of the patchy fog area (for
       example, a diameter of its bounding sphere). Use function
       <B>pfVolFog::setVal</B> to modify the maximum distance parameter.
       When the faster patchy fog algorithm is used only the den-
       sity can be varied using a layered fog.

       Layered patchy fog nodes can be moved and rotated by spec-
       ifying a matrix for each fog node, identified by its index
       (the order in which nodes were specified). A version of
       the function <B>pfVolFog::setAttr</B> with three parameters can
       be used. The first parameter is PFVFOG_ROTATE_NODE, the
       second parameter specified the node index and the last one
       is a pointer to a pfMatrix.

       Cull programs (see pfCullProgram) can speed up rendering
       of patchy fog because in some draw passes only the part of
       the scene intersecting the fog boundary is rendered. To
       enable cull programs set flag PFVFOG_FLAG_USE_CULL_PROGRAM
       to 1.
       decreasing intensity (density) along the cone axis. Addi-
       tional rendering passes darken the objects outside the
       cone of light and lit the objects inside the light shaft
       based on their distance from the light.  To enable these
       additional passes set flag PFVFOG_FLAG_LIGHT_SHAFT to 1.
       To ensure that these passes are applied even if the light
       shaft is not in the field of view you have to also set
       flag PFVFOG_FLAG_LAYERED_PATCHY_FOG to 1.

       To control the additional passes the parameter PFV-
       FOG_LIGHT_SHAFT_DARKEN_FACTOR (set using
       <B>pfVolFog::setAttr</B>) can change the factor by which all
       objects outside the light shaft are darkened.  The default
       value is 0.3.  Parameters PFVFOG_LIGHT_SHAFT_ATTEN_SCALE
       and PFVFOG_LIGHT_SHAFT_ATTEN_TRANSLATE set the translate
       and scaling of the one-dimensional texture that is used to
       reduce the color of objects lit by the light. It is recom-
       mended to set the translate to a small value, e.g. 10-20%
       of the shaft length, and the scale to the inverse of the
       shaft length.

       Since light shafts are using a combination of layered and
       patchy fog and the density is decreasing to 0 at the end
       of the light cone the quality of results is very sensitive
       to the depth of color buffers.  12-bit visuals are
       required and the light shaft should not be too large.
       Also make sure that PFVFOG_MAX_DISTANCE is set as small as
       possible.  See program perf/samples/apps/C++/volfog for an
       example of setting up a light shaft.



       HINTS

       A layered fog is faster to render than a patchy fog, thus
       if draw is very slow try to use a layered fog instead of a
       patchy fog. Rendering of both types of fog together is
       even slower and you may try to define only one type.

       Changing the fog mode does not affect the rendering speed
       in case of a layered fog but rendering of a patchy fog is
       slower for fog modes PFVFOG_EXP and PFVFOG_EXP2. If you
       prefer using non-linear modes try to use them only for the
       layered fog and not for the patchy fog.

       You can speed up drawing of a patchy fog by reducing the
       size of the fog boundaries. In case of several disjoint
       fog areas the size of a bounding box containing all bound-
       aries affects the draw time and quality.  Try to avoid
       defining a patchy fog in two opposite parts of your scene.
       Try also to increase the value of <I>resolution</I> (if there are
       not too many overlapping fog boundaries) or reduce the
       patchy fog density.


       If there is a lot of banding visible in the fog try to
       choose a visual with as many bits per color component as
       possible. Keep in mind that a patchy fog needs stencil
       buffer.  You can also try to apply all techniques men-
       that front faces always face outside the foggy area.

       If you see a darker band in a layered fog at the eye level
       make sure that the texture size is set so that the second
       value is greater or equal than the third value.


       LIMITATIONS

       Layered fog:

              The 3D texture coordinates for a layered fog are
              determined at each vertex and interpolated across a
              polygon. Consequently, an object located on top of
              a large ground polygon may be fogged a bit more or
              less than the part of the polygon just under the
              object.

              A layered fog works fast with a 3d texture. Reload-
              ing of 2d textures during the animation can be
              slow.

              When the layered fog is self-shadowed, only a sin-
              gle white light source coming from the top is con-
              sidered.

       Patchy fog:

              The method does not work well for semi-transparent
              surfaces. If your scene contains objects that are
              semitransparent or that have semi-transparent edges
              (for example, tree billboards or mountains in Per-
              former town) these objects or edges may be cut or
              may be fogged more than the neighboring pixels.
              Even if a semi-transparent edge of a billboard is
              outside the fog it will not be smooth.  Set flag
              PFVFOG_FASTER_PATCHY_FOG to use a different algo-
              rithm that does not have these problems. The faster
              algorithm, on the other hand, suffers from the same
              problems as layered fog because the fog factors are
              determined at each vertex and interpolated across a
              polygon.


              All areas of a patchy fog have the same color.

              The default algorithm for patchy fog does not work
              with pfEarthSky.


              A layered patchy fog is extremely sensitive to the
              size of the fog area and the density of the layered
              fog. Specifically, the fog values accumulated along
              an arbitrary line crossing the bounding box of the
              fog area should not reach 1.

              A patchy fog needs stencil buffer and as deep color
              buffers as possible.  The rendering quality on a
              visual with less than 12 bits per color component
