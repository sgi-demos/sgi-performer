<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A pfPipe is a software rendering pipeline which renders
       one or more pfChannels into one or more pfPipeWindows. A
       pfPipe can be configured as multiple processes for
       increased throughput on multiprocessor systems. Multiple
       pfPipes can operate in parallel in support of platforms
       with multiple graphics pipelines.  The number of pfPipes
       and the multiprocessing mode used are set by <B>pfMultipipe</B>
       and <B>pfMultiprocess</B> respectively (see <B>pfConfig</B>).

       A pfPipe references one or more pfPipeWindows which in
       turn reference one or more pfChannels. A pfChannel is sim-
       ply a view of a scene which is rendered into a viewport of
       a pfPipeWindow.  A pfPipeWindow is a graphics window man-
       aged by its parent pfPipe.

       pfPipes, pfPipeWindows, and pfChannels form a hierarchy
       with the following rules:


              1.   A screen (i.e. hardware graphics display) can
                   have multiple pfPipes but should only have one
                   drawing to it

              2.   A pfPipe may only draw to one screen

              3.   A pfPipe may render to multiple pfPipeWindows

              4.   A pfPipeWindow belongs to a single fixed
                   pfPipe and thus also to a single fixed screen

              5.   A pfPipeWindow may have multiple pfChannels

              6.   A pfChannel always belongs to a pfPipe but may
                   change pfPipeWindows or might not belong to
                   any pfPipeWindow.  a channel not assigned to a
                   pfPipeWindow is culled but not drawn.

       The following is an example pfPipe-&gt;pfPipeWindow-&gt;pfChan-
       nel configuration.

       Example 1:


       The screen:

           |   |            |       |                      |

           +-----------------------------------------------+



       The hierarchy:

                       screen0 ....
                         |
                         |

                      /       \                     |
               pfPipeWindow0   pfPipeWindow1        |
                 /     \          \                 |
                /       \          \                |

                                                (not drawn)

       The code: (in application process)

           /* Calls that create the hierarchy: */
           pfPipe          *pipe = <B>pfGetPipe(0)</B>;
           pfPipeWindow    *pwin0 = new pfPipeWindow(pipe);
           pfPipeWindow    *pwin1 = new pfPipeWindow(pipe);

           pfChannel  *chan0 = new pfChannel(pipe);
           pfChannel  *chan1 = new pfChannel(pipe);
           pfChannel  *chan2 = new pfChannel(pipe);

           pwin0-&gt;addChan(chan0);
           pwin0-&gt;addChan(chan1);
           pwin1-&gt;addChan(chan2);

           /* Calls that cause the window to be opened at next pfFrame() */
           pwin0-&gt;open();
           pwin1-&gt;open();
           pfFrame();


       If a pfPipe has no windows at the time <B>pfFrame</B> is called,
       a full screen pfPipeWindow will be opened for <I>pipe</I> and all
       pfChannels of <I>pipe</I> will be assigned to that pfPipeWindow.

       <B>pfPipe::getClassType</B> returns the <B>pfType</B>* for the class
       <B>pfPipe</B>.  The <B>pfType</B>* returned by <B>pfPipe::getClassType</B> is
       the same as the <B>pfType</B>* returned by invoking the virtual
       function <B>getType</B> on any instance of class <B>pfPipe</B>.  Because
       OpenGL Performer allows subclassing of built-in types,
       when decisions are made based on the type of an object, it
       is usually better to use  the member function <B>isOfType</B> to
       application process before the call to open or configure
       any pfPipeWindows (<B>pfPipeWindow::open</B>,
       <B>pfPipeWindow::config</B>) on the pfPipe, or may be specified
       implicitly by the screen of the first opened pfPipeWindow.
       A pfPipe is tied to a specific hardware pipeline and the
       screen of a pfPipe cannot be changed once determined.  For
       single pipe operation, if the screen of a pfPipe or
       pfPipeWindow is never explicitly set in single pipe con-
       figuration, the screen will be taken from the default
       screen of the current pfWSConnection, or current X Dis-
       play.  For multipipe operation, if the screen of a pfPipe
       or pfPipeWindow is never explicitly set and pfMultipipe()
       has been used to configure multiple pfPipes, then pfPipes
       will automatically be assigned to hardware screens in
       order, i.e., <B>pfGetPipe(0)</B> -&gt; screen 0, <B>pfGetPipe(1)</B> -&gt;
       screen 1, etc.  If a custom mapping of pfPipes to screens
       is desired, the screens of all pfPipes must be specified
       before the configuration of the first pfPipe which will
       happen at the first call to <B>pfFrame</B>.  See the
       <B>pfGetCurWSConnection</B> reference  page for more details on
       how to manage X display connections.

       <B>pfPipe::setWSConnectionName</B> allows you to specify both a
       window server target and screen for the pfPipe.  This is
       useful for doing remote rendering, or for running on a
       system with multiple window servers. This call should be
       made in the application process, before the first call to
       pfFrame.  <B>pfPipe::getWSConnectionName</B> will return the cur-
       rent window server target name.  A window server target
       specified on a pfPipe will take precedence over any such
       targets specified on pfPipeWindows of that pfPipe.  If the
       window server target of a pfPipe has not been set, it may
       be implicitly set from the first such setting on a child
       pfPipeWindow.  The window server target of a pfPipe may
       not be changed after the first call to <B>pfFrame</B>.  See the
       <B>pfGetCurWSConnection</B> reference  page for more details on
       how to manage X display connections.

       <B>pfPipe::getScreen</B> can be used to get the screen of a
       pfPipe.  A return value of (-1) indicates that the screen
       of the pfPipe is undefined.  <B>pfPipe::getSize</B> returns the
       size of the screen used by the pfPipe.

       For best performance only one pfPipe should render to a
       given hardware pipeline. If multiple views on a single
       screen are desired, use multiple pfChannels, and if neces-
       sary, multiple pfPipeWindows.

       Normally a pfPipe swaps the color buffers at the end of
       each frame.  However, if special control is needed over
       buffer swapping, <B>pfPipe::setSwapFunc</B> will register <I>func</I> as
       the buffer swapping function for the pfPipe.  Instead of
       swapping buffers, <I>func</I> will be called and will be expected
       to swap the color buffers of the provided pfPipeWindow.
       <B>pfPipe::getSwapFunc</B> returns the buffer swapping function
       of the pfPipe or <B>NULL</B> if none is set.

       If you wish to frame lock multiple pfPipes so that each
       pfPipe swaps its color buffers at the same time, then you
       on the pfPipe.

       <B>pfPipe::getNumPWins</B> returns the number of pfPipeWindows
       that have been created on the pfPipe.  <B>pfPipe::getNumChans</B>
       returns the number of pfChannels that have been created on
       the pfPipe.

       <B>pfPipe::movePWin</B> moves the specified pfPipeWindow <I>pwin</I> to
       the location specified by <I>where</I> in the pfPipeWindow list
       on the pfPipe.  The move includes removing <I>pwin</I> from its
       current location by moving up the elements in the list
       that follow it and then inserting <I>pwin</I> into its new loca-
       tion.  If <I>pwin</I> is attached to the pfPipe, (-1) is returned
       and <I>pwin</I> is not inserted into the list.  Otherwise, <I>where</I>
       is returned to indicate success.  <I>where</I> must be within the
       range [0 .. n] where n is the number returned by
       <B>pfPipe::getNumPWins</B>(), or else (-1) is returned and no
       move is executed.

       <B>pfPipe::getChan</B> returns the pointer to the pfChannel at
       location <I>which</I> in the list of pfChannels on the pfPipe.

       <B>pfPipe::getLoad</B> returns the current instantaneous load
       (ratio of time required to process a frame and the time
       allotted for that frame's processing) for the pipe.

       <B>pfPipe::bindVChans</B> binds all pfPipeVideoChannels associ-
       ated with the pfPipe to the video hardware.
       <B>pfPipe::unbindPVChans</B> performs the opposite action,
       unbinding each from the video hardware.


       Example 2: How to frame lock pfPipes

       leftChan  = new pfChannel(<B>pfGetPipe(0)</B>);
       rightChan = new pfChannel(<B>pfGetPipe(1)</B>);

       /* BPFCHAN_SWAPBUFFERS is shared by default */
       leftChan-&gt;attach(rightChan);

       /* Pipe 0 and pipe 1 are now frame-locked */



   <B>USING</B> <B>PFPIPES</B> <B>TO</B> <B>APPLY</B> <B>INCREMENTAL</B> <B>GRAPHICS</B> <B>STATE</B>
       pfPipe's are also the level at which hardware pipeline
       specific graphics state can be applied.  The only two cur-
       rently supported incremental graphics state elements that
       can be applied on a per-pipe basis are pfMPClipTexture's.
       Both of the libpf primitives provide support for incremen-
       tally paging texture from memory into texture memory which
       contains a texture cache that differs on a per frame
       basis.  Thus by attaching these structures to a pfPipe,
       the pfPipe will provide frame accurate applying and down-
       loading of these texture primitives.  Note that this
       incremental downloading should be attached to a channel
       such that loading statistics can be accumulated.

       <B>pfPipe::setIncrementalStateChanNum</B> sets the channel with
       <B>pfPipe::addMPClipTexture</B> is used to associate a pfMPClip-
       Texture with a particular pfPipe.  This association forces
       the pfPipe to apply the pfMPClipTexture and download the
       resulting incremental texture changes in a frame accurate
       manner. If a pfMPClipTexture is added to a pipe that is
       already connected to another pipe, the function silently
       creates a new pfMPClipTexture, makes it a slave of the
       pfMPClipTexture that is already connected to another pipe,
       and adds the slave to the pipe in place of the one passed
       as an argument to the function.

       <B>pfPipe::removeMPClipTexture</B> is used to remove the associa-
       tion of a pfMPClipTexture from a pfPipe such that the
       pfPipe will no longer manage the incremental application
       of the pfMPClipTexture. If a pfMPClipTexture is removed
       that is the master of other pfMPClipTextures, the slaves
       will be removed from their pipes as well.

       <B>pfPipe::getNumMPClipTextures</B> returns the number of pfMP-
       ClipTextures that have been attached to the pfPipe.

       <B>pfPipe::getMPClipTexture</B> returns the <I>which</I>th pfMPClipTex-
       ture that has been attached to the pfPipe.

       <B>pfPipe::setTotalTexLoadTime</B> sets the total amount of tex-
       ture download time in (milliseconds) allocated for all the
       pfMPClipTextures attached to this pfPipe.  This download
       time is used by the pfMPClipTexture's DTR load control
       system to update texture memory as the pfMPClipTexture's
       center is moved.

       The total download time is distributed among the pfMPClip-
       Textures attached to the pfPipe by examining the value of
       each pfMPClipTexture's load time fraction parameter. This
       floating point number is queried from each pfMPClipTexture
       attached to the pfPipe and the results are summed. The
       resulting value used to normalize each pfMPClipTexture's
       load time fraction value.

       Each pfMPClipTexture's normalized load time fraction value
       is used to scale the total download time. The result is
       the download time available for that pfMPClipTexture. If
       the pfMPClipTexture has had a texture download time set
       via <B>pfMPClipTexture::setTexLoadTime</B>, then that value takes
       precedence, and the the scaled total download time is
       ignored by that pfMPClipTexture.

       <B>pfPipe::getTotalTexLoadTime</B> return the current value for
       total texture download time. The default value is 6 mil-
       liseconds.

       <B>pfGetPipeNum</B> returns the pipeline number for the current
       OpenGL Performer pipeline process. <B>pfGetPipeNum</B> returns
       (-1) if invoked in a process that isn't associated with a
       pfPipe.  Only the CULL, DRAW, and LPOINT processes have
       valid pipe numbers.

       <B>pfGetPipeDrawCount</B> will return the frame count of the last
       draw to complete for the pfPipe. This can be called in the
