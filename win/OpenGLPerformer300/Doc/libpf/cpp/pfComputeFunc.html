<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <I>func</I> argument to <B>pfComputeFunc</B> specifies the compute
       callback function.  This function will be invoked by
       <B>pfFrame</B> and will be passed a pointer to a data buffer
       allocated by <B>pfAllocComputeData</B>.  If a separate process is
       allocated for asynchronous computation by the
       <B>PFMP_FORK_COMPUTE</B> mode to <B>pfMultiprocess</B>, then <B>pfFrame</B>
       will cause <I>func</I> to be called in the separate (<B>COMPUTE</B>)
       process.  <B>pfGetComputeFunc</B> returns the compute callback or
       <B>NULL</B> if none is set.

       The compute function's primary purpose is to provide a
       place for per-frame asynchronous computation.  The results
       of such computation may be placed in pfFlux objects for
       use in the scene graph or by the asynchronous rendering
       pipeline; see the man page for <B>new</B> <B>pfFlux</B>). The compute
       process is automatically used by some OpenGL Performer
       objects, such as pfASD, that require extensive computation
       that can be done asynchronously and potentially extend
       beyond the time for a frame.  see <B>new</B> <B>pfASD</B>).

       When the compute function is in a separate process, it
       will run asynchronously with the rest of the rendering
       pipeline. Specifically, if the compute function takes more
       than a frame time, the rendering pipeline will not be
       affected.

       Unlike the intersection and cull processes, there is no
       copy of the scene graph in the compute process.  Only
       pfFlux objects can be safely inspected or edited by the
       compute process.  It is not valid to look at any pfNode in
       results are stored in a pfFlux, this should not be neces-
       sary.

       If a compute function has been specified by <B>pfComputeFunc</B>,
       it must call <B>pfCompute</B> to carry out default OpenGL Per-
       former compute processing. <B>pfCompute</B> should only be called
       from within the <B>COMPUTE</B> callback in the <B>COMPUTE</B> process
       just like <B>pfCull</B> and <B>pfDraw</B> should only be called in the
       pfChannel <B>CULL</B> and <B>DRAW</B> callbacks (<B>pfChannel::setTravFunc</B>)
       respectively. If a compute function has not been specified
       or is <B>NULL</B>, OpenGL Performer automatically calls <B>pfCompute</B>
       from <B>pfFrame</B>.

       <B>pfAllocComputeData</B> returns a pointer to a chunk of shared
       memory of <I>bytes</I> bytes.  This memory buffer may be used to
       communicate information between the compute function and
       application.  Compute data should only be allocated once.
       <B>pfGetComputeData</B> returns the previously allocated compute
       data.

       When the compute function is forked, <B>pfPassComputeData</B>
       should be used to copy the compute data into internal
       OpenGL Performer memory when the next <B>pfFrame</B> is called.
       Once <B>pfFrame</B> is called, the application may modify data in
       the compute data buffer without fear of colliding with the
       forked compute function. However, modifications to the
       compute data chunk made by the <B>COMPUTE</B> process will not be
       visible to the <B>APP</B> process, i.e, there is no "upstream"
       propagation of passthrough data.  For managing sending
       upstream or asynchronous processes to receive the results
       of the compute process, you can use pfFlux objects.
