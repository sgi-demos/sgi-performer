<H2>PARENT CLASS FUNCTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The OpenGL Performer class <B>pfLayer</B>  is  derived  from  the
       parent class <B>pfGroup</B>, so each of these member functions of
       class <B>pfGroup</B> are also directly  usable  with  objects  of
       class  <B>pfLayer</B>.  This is also true for ancestor classes of
       class <B>pfGroup</B>.

       int        <B>pfGroup::addChild</B>(pfNode *child);
       int        <B>pfGroup::insertChild</B>(int index, pfNode *child);
       int        <B>pfGroup::replaceChild</B>(pfNode *old,         pfN-
                    ode *new);
       int        <B>pfGroup::removeChild</B>(pfNode* child);
       int        <B>pfGroup::searchChild</B>(pfNode* child);
       pfNode *   <B>pfGroup::getChild</B>(int index);
       int        <B>pfGroup::getNumChildren</B>(void);
       int        <B>pfGroup::bufferAddChild</B>(pfNode *child);
       int        <B>pfGroup::bufferRemoveChild</B>(pfNode *child);


       Since the class <B>pfGroup</B> is itself derived from the  parent
       class  <B>pfNode</B>,  objects  of class <B>pfLayer</B> can also be used
       with these functions designed for objects of class <B>pfNode</B>.

       pfGroup *      <B>pfNode::getParent</B>(int i);
       int            <B>pfNode::getNumParents</B>(void);
       void           <B>pfNode::setBound</B>(pfSphere *bsph, int mode);
       int            <B>pfNode::getBound</B>(pfSphere *bsph);
       pfNode*        <B>pfNode::clone</B>(int mode);
       pfNode*        <B>pfNode::lookup</B>(const char *name,
                        pfType* type);
       int            <B>pfNode::isect</B>(pfSegSet *segSet,
                        pfHit **hits[]);
       void           <B>pfNode::setTravMask</B>(int which,   uint mask,
                        int setMode, int bitOp);
       uint           <B>pfNode::getTravMask</B>(int which);
       void           <B>pfNode::setTravFuncs</B>(int which, pfNodeTrav-
                        FuncType pre, pfNodeTravFuncType post);
       void           <B>pfNode::getTravFuncs</B>(int which, pfNodeTrav-
                        FuncType *pre,          pfNodeTravFunc-
                        Type *post);
       void           <B>pfNode::setTravData</B>(int which, void *data);
       void *         <B>pfNode::getTravData</B>(int which);
       void           <B>pfNode::setTravMode</B>(int which,    int mode,
                        int val);
       int            <B>pfNode::getTravMode</B>(int which,
                        int mode) const;


       Since the class <B>pfNode</B> is itself derived from  the  parent
       class  <B>pfObject</B>, objects of class <B>pfLayer</B> can also be used
       with  these  functions  designed  for  objects  of   class
       <B>pfObject</B>.

       void*   <B>pfObject::operator</B> <B>new</B>(size_t);
       void*   <B>pfObject::operator</B> <B>new</B>(size_t, void *arena);
       void*   <B>pfObject::operator</B>      <B>new</B>(size_t,     pfFluxMem-
                 ory *fmem);
       void    <B>pfObject::setUserData</B>(void *data);
       void    <B>pfObject::setUserData</B>(int slot, void *data);
       void*   <B>pfObject::getUserData</B>(pfObject *obj);
       void*   <B>pfObject::getUserData</B>(pfObject *obj, int slot);
       int     <B>pfObject::getNumUserData</B>();


       Since the class <B>pfObject</B> is itself derived from the parent
       class  <B>pfMemory</B>, objects of class <B>pfLayer</B> can also be used
       with  these  functions  designed  for  objects  of   class
       <B>pfMemory</B>.

       void*          <B>pfMemory::getData</B>(const void *ptr);
       pfType *       <B>pfMemory::getType</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::isOfType</B>(pfType *type);
       int            <B>pfMemory::isExactType</B>(pfType *type);
       const char *   <B>pfMemory::getTypeName</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::copy</B>(pfMemory *src);
       int            <B>pfMemory::compare</B>(const pfMemory *mem);
       void           <B>pfMemory::print</B>(uint which,   uint verbose,
                        char *prefix, FILE *file);
       int            <B>pfMemory::getArena</B>(void *ptr);
       void*          <B>pfMemory::getArena</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::ref</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::unref</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::unrefDelete</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::unrefGetRef</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::getRef</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::checkDelete</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::isFluxed</B>();
       proper drawing of coplanar geometry on OpenGL platforms.

       A  pfLayer  can be thought of as a stack of geometry where
       each layer has visual priority over the  geometry  beneath
       it  in  the stack.  An example of a 3 layer stack consists
       of stripes which are layered over a runway which  is  lay-
       ered  over  the ground. The bottommost layer is called the
       "base" while the other layers are called  "decals".   When
       using  certain  hardware mechanisms (<B>PFDECAL_BASE_STENCIL</B>)
       to implement pfLayers, the "base" is  special  because  it
       defines  the  depth  values  which  are  used to determine
       pfLayer visibility with respect to  other  scene  geometry
       and which are written to the depth buffer.

       <B>new</B>  <B>pfLayer</B>  creates  and  returns a handle to a pfLayer.
       Like other pfNodes, pfLayers  are  always  allocated  from
       shared  memory  and  cannot  be created statically, on the
       stack or in arrays.   pfLayers  should  be  deleted  using
       <B>pfDelete</B> rather than the delete operator.

       <B>pfLayer::getClassType</B>  returns  the  <B>pfType</B>* for the class
       <B>pfLayer</B>.  The <B>pfType</B>* returned by <B>pfLayer::getClassType</B> is
       the  same  as the <B>pfType</B>* returned by invoking the virtual
       function  <B>getType</B>  on  any  instance  of  class   <B>pfLayer</B>.
       Because  OpenGL  Performer  allows subclassing of built-in
       types, when decisions are made based on  the  type  of  an
       object,  it  is usually better to use  the member function
       <B>isOfType</B> to test if an object is of a type derived from  a
       Performer  type rather than to test for strict equality of
       the <B>pfType</B>*'s.

       Since pfLayer is derived from pfGroup, pfGroup API may  be
       used  to manipulate its child list.  OpenGL Performer con-
       siders child 0 to be the  base  geometry  and  children  1
       through  N-1  to  be decals.  Decals are rendered in order
       such that decal[i+1] is  drawn  atop  decal[i].  In  other
       words,  decal[i+1]  has visual priority over decal[i] even
       though   they   are   coplanar.    <B>pfLayer::setBase</B>    and
       <B>pfLayer::setDecal</B> are convenience routines for setting the
       base and decal children of the pfLayer in the common  case
       where there is only one decal child.  <B>pfLayer::getBase</B> and
       <B>pfLayer::getDecal</B> return the base and first child  of  the
       pfLayer.

       The  <I>mode</I>  argument  to  <B>pfLayer::setMode</B>  specifies which
       hardware mechanism to use and is one of:

              <B>PFDECAL_BASE_DISPLACE</B>
                   Use  slope-based   polygon   displacement   to
                   slightly  displace  the  depth values of decal
                   geometry closer to the eye so they have visual
                   priority.  Each  decal  is displaced more than
                   its predecessor to properly  resolve  priority
                   between  decals.  The maximum number of decals
                   is 8.

              <B>PFDECAL_BASE_DISPLACE</B> | <B>PFDECAL_LAYER_OFFSET</B>
                   Use  slope-based   polygon   displacement   to
                   slightly  displace  the  depth values of decal
                   number of decals is 8.

              <B>PFDECAL_BASE_STENCIL</B>
                   Use the stencil-buffer logic to determine vis-
                   ibility of decal geometry.  There is no  limit
                   to the number of decals.

              <B>PFDECAL_BASE_FAST</B>
                   Use  a  decaling  mechanism appropriate to the
                   hardware that produces the  fastest,  but  not
                   necessarily the highest quality, decaling.

              <B>PFDECAL_BASE_HIGH_QUALITY</B>
                   Use  a  decaling  mechanism appropriate to the
                   hardware that produces  the  highest  quality,
                   but not necessarily the fastest, decaling.

       The  decal  mode  may also include the <B>PFDECAL_PLANE</B> token
       OR-ed with one of the above tokens which will  enable  the
       use    of    the   decal   reference   plane   (set   with
       <B>pfLayer::setPlane</B>).  This can offer much higher quality of
       <B>PFDECAL_BASE_DISPLACE</B> type layers.

       The    default    layer    mode    is   <B>PFDECAL_BASE_FAST</B>.
       <B>pfLayer::getMode</B> returns the mode of the pfLayer.

       The different pfLayer modes offer  quality-feature  trade-
       offs listed in the table below:

       center  tab($);  C | C | C | C L | L | L | L.  $<B>DISPLACE</B>$-
       <B>STENCIL</B>$<B>(DISPLACE</B>  <B>|</B>  <B>OFFSET)</B>  _  Quality$medium$high$high
       Sorting$enabled$disabled$enabled           Coplanarity$not
       required$required$not required Multipass$ok$not ok$ok Con-
       tainment$not required$required$not required

       The <B>STENCIL</B> mechanism offers the best image quality but at
       a performance cost since the base and layer geometry  must
       be rendered in order, obviating any benefits of sorting by
       graphics state offered by <B>pfChannel::setBinSort</B>. When mul-
       tisampling  on RealityEngine, this mechanism also signifi-
       cantly reduces pixel fill  performance.   The  performance
       impact  is  not  as severe in InfiniteReality systems.  An
       additional constraint is that  <B>STENCIL</B>ed  layers  must  be
       coplanar  or  decal  geometry may incorrectly show through
       base geometry. A subtle but important issue with <B>STENCIL</B>ed
       layers  is  that they are unsuitable for multipass render-
       ings (projected textures) since multiple surfaces are vis-
       ible  at a given pixel.  For proper results, each layer in
       the "stack" must be completely contained within the bound-
       aries of the base geometry.

       The  <B>DISPLACE</B>  mechanism offers the best performance since
       layers can be sorted by graphics state, because  the  dis-
       place  call  itself  is  usually  faster  than  other mode
       changes, and because there is no pixel fill  rate  penalty
       when  it  is  in use. The <B>OFFSET</B> mechanism adds a constant
       offset to the decal geometry. This mode can be very expen-
       sive  (RealityEngine) so when using it the database should
       be sorted with <B>PFSTATE_DECAL</B> as the first sorting key (see

       The  performance  differences between <B>STENCIL</B> and <B>DISPLACE</B>
       modes are hardware-dependent so some  experimentation  and
       benchmarking  is  required  to determine the most suitable
       method for your application.

       <B>pfLayer::setPlane</B> sets a reference plane to  be  used  for
       all  geometry  under  the pfLayer node.  <B>pfLayer::getPlane</B>
       returns the reference plane, or NULL if no such  plane  is
       set on the pfLayer.



</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Using <B>PFDECAL_BASE_STENCIL</B> for pfLayer nodes requires sev-
       eral steps for proper operation. First, the graphics hard-
       ware  must  support stencil plane rendering. Secondly, the
       graphics context must be  configured  with  at  least  one
       stencil  plane,  and the lowest order bit of the allocated
       stencil planes  be  reserved  for  OpenGL  Performer  use.
       <B>pfInitGfx</B>  configures  the  graphics  context in just this
       way.

       The use of displacements for rendering  coplanar  geometry
       can  cause visual artifacts such as decals "Z fighting" or
       "flimmering" when viewed perpendicularly, and the  "punch-
       ing through" of decals that should mask base geometry when
       both are viewed obliquely.  The  former  artifact  can  be
       eliminated    by    specifying   <B>PFDECAL_BASE_DISPLACE</B>   |
       <B>PFDECAL_LAYER_OFFSET</B> as the layer mode. Subtle details  of
       this rendering mode are described in the <B>pfDecal</B> man page.
       If unacceptable  artifacts  still  persist,  the  database
       should be modified to eliminate the need for coplanar ren-
       dering or <B>PFDECAL_BASE_HIGH_QUALITY</B> should be used.

       When using <B>PFDECAL_LAYER_OFFSET</B>, the minimum depth  buffer
       range set with <B>lsetdepth</B> must be incremented an extra 1024
       * max layers so the negative displacement  of  the  layers
       does not wrap.  <B>pfInitGfx</B> does this automatically.


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       OpenGL  Performer  properly renders coplanar geometry only
       on machines that have a hardware stencil buffer  allocated
       or which support displaced polygon rendering.
