<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A pfBuffer is a data structure that logically  encompasses
       <B>libpf</B>  objects  such as pfNodes. Newly created objects are
       automatically "attached" to the current pfBuffer specified
       by  <B>pfBuffer::select</B>.   Later,  any objects created in the
       pfBuffer may be merged into the main OpenGL Performer pro-
       cessing stream with <B>pfBuffer::merge</B>. In conjunction with a
       forked <B>DBASE</B> process (see <B>pfMultiprocess</B> and <B>pfDBaseFunc</B>),
       the pfBuffer mechanism supports asynchronous parallel cre-
       ation and deletion of database objects.  This is the foun-
       dation of a real-time database paging system.

       <B>new</B>  <B>pfBuffer</B>  creates and returns a handle to a pfBuffer.
       pfBuffers cannot be created statically, on the stack, from
       the heap or in arrays.

       given pfBuffer should only be current in a single  process
       at  any  given  time.   In  this way, a pfBuffer restricts
       access to a given object to  a  single  process,  avoiding
       hard-to-find errors due to multiprocessed data collisions.
       <B>pfGetCurBuffer</B> returns the current pfBuffer.

       Only <B>libpf</B> objects are subject to pfBuffer access restric-
       tions.   <B>libpf</B>  objects  include  pfNodes such as pfGroup,
       pfGeode and pfUpdatables such  as  pfLODState,  pfChannel,
       pfEarthSky.  <B>libpr</B> objects such as pfGeoSets, pfGeoStates,
       and pfMaterials have no pfBuffer restrictions so they  may
       be  accessed by any process at any time although care must
       be taken by the application to avoid multiprocessed colli-
       sions on these data structures.

       <B>pfBuffer::merge</B>  merges the current pfBuffer with the main
       OpenGL Performer pfBuffer.  This main pfBuffer is  created
       by  <B>pfConfig</B>  and  will  resist  deletion  and merging and
       should only be made current in the <B>APP</B>  process  (however,
       it  is  legal to select a different buffer in the <B>APP</B> pro-
       cess).  If  called  in  a  process  other  than  the  <B>APP</B>,
       <B>pfBuffer::merge</B>  will block until the <B>APP</B> calls <B>pfSync</B>, at
       which time the <B>APP</B> will merge the  current  pfBuffer  into
       the   main  pfBuffer  and  then  allow  the  process  that
       requested the merge to continue. If  called  in  the  <B>APP</B>,
       <B>pfBuffer::merge</B> will immediately execute the merge.  After
       <B>pfBuffer::merge</B> returns, any objects that were created  in
       the  current pfBuffer may only be accessed in the <B>APP</B> pro-
       cess when the <B>APP</B> pfBuffer has been selected as  the  cur-
       rent  pfBuffer.   In  other words, the merged pfBuffer has
       been "reset" and its objects now "exist" only in  the  <B>APP</B>
       pfBuffer.  The  addresses of <B>libpf</B> objects are not changed
       by <B>pfBuffer::merge</B>.

       Any  number  of  pfBuffers  may  be  used  and  merged  (-
       <B>pfBuffer::merge</B>)  by  any  number  of processes for multi-
       threaded database manipulation, subject to  the  following
       restrictions:


              1.     A  given  pfBuffer  should  be  current (via
                     <B>pfBuffer::select</B>) in only a  single  process
                     at any given time.

              2.     Each  process  which selects a pfBuffer must
                     be <B>fork</B>ed, not <B>sproc</B>ed.

       Specifically, pfBuffer usage  is  not  restricted  to  the
       <B>DBASE</B> process (see <B>pfConfig</B>).

       <B>pfGroup::bufferAddChild</B>   and   <B>pfGroup::bufferRemoveChild</B>
       provide access to nodes that do not exist in  the  current
       pfBuffer.   Either, none, or both of the pfBuffer and <I>node</I>
       may    exist     outside     the     current     pfBuffer.
       <B>pfGroup::bufferAddChild</B> and <B>pfGroup::bufferRemoveChild</B> act
       just     like     their     non-buffered      counterparts
       <B>pfGroup::addChild</B> and <B>pfGroup::removeChild</B> except that the
       addition or removal request is not carried out immediately
       but  is  recorded  by the current pfBuffer. The request is
       otherwise.

       <B>pfBuffer::set</B>  sets  the specified child <I>index</I> of a <I>parent</I>
       node to the given <I>child</I>. It acts as a replace command  but
       uses  an index to identify the replaced child. The current
       implementation supports <B>pfBuffer::set</B> only for  setting  a
       source array in a <B>pfAlign</B> node.

       In       addition       to       the      pfGroup-specific
       <B>pfGroup::bufferAddChild</B>   and   <B>pfGroup::bufferRemoveChild</B>
       routines,  a  pfBuffer  allows generic list management for
       pfGroup, pfGeode, pfText, and pfPipeWindow objects.  These
       functions,    <B>pfGroup::bufferAdd</B>,   <B>pfGroup::bufferRemove</B>,
       <B>pfGroup::bufferInsert</B>, <B>pfGroup::bufferReplace</B> can be  used
       to manage a pfGroup's list of pfNodes, a pfGeode's list of
       pfGeoSets, a pfText's list of pfStrings, or  a  pfPipeWin-
       dow's  list  of  pfChannels  respectively.  These routines
       infer the proper action to take from the  argument  types.
       For  example, the following code fragment is equivalent to
       <B>group-&gt;bufferAddChild(geode)</B>:


       pfGroup   *group;
       pfGeode   *geode;

       pfBuffer::add(group, geode);


       <B>pfGroup::bufferAdd</B>, <B>pfGroup::bufferRemove</B>,
       <B>pfGroup::bufferInsert</B>, <B>pfGroup::bufferReplace</B>,
       <B>pfBuffer::set</B> all act similarly in that they do not have
       effect until <B>pfBuffer::merge</B> is called and all parties
       have been merged into the main OpenGL Performer buffer.
       They return -1 if the argument types are not consistent
       (e.g., pfBuffer::remove(group, geoset)), 0 if the request
       is immediately processed (this happens when all parties
       already have scope in the current pfBuffer), and 1 if the
       request is buffered until the next <B>pfBuffer::merge</B>.

       <B>pfBuffer::setScope</B> sets the scope of <I>obj</I> with respect to
       the pfBuffer. If <I>scope</I> is TRUE, then <I>obj</I> is "added" to the
       pfBuffer so that when the pfBuffer is made current (-
       <B>pfBuffer::select</B>) in a process, <I>obj</I> may be accessed
       through OpenGL Performer routines in that same process.
       When <I>scope</I> is FALSE, <I>obj</I> is "removed" from the pfBuffer.
       <B>pfBuffer::setScope</B>'s primary purpose is to move objects
       between pfBuffers, particularly from the main <B>APP</B> pfBuffer
       into an application pfBuffer typically used for asyn-
       chronous database manipulations.  In this case the
       object's scope would be set to FALSE in the old pfBuffer
       and TRUE in the new pfBuffer.  It is undefined when an
       object has scope in multiple pfBuffers since this violates
       the multiprocessing data exclusion requirement of OpenGL
       Performer.  <B>pfBuffer::getScope</B> returns TRUE or FALSE indi-
       cating the scope of <I>obj</I> in pfBuffer the pfBuffer.

       When using pfBuffers for database paging, it is sometimes
       desirable to retain certain, common database models
       ("library models") in memory.  Examples are trees, houses,
       2 performance problems:

              1.     <B>pfBuffer::merge</B> will adversely impact the
                     <B>APP</B> process, proportional to the number of
                     <B>pfBuffer::addChild</B> and <B>pfBuffer::removeChild</B>
                     requests.

              2.     Transformations in the scene graph reduce
                     OpenGL Performer's ability to sort the
                     database (see <B>pfChannel::setBinSort</B>) and
                     matrix operations have some cost in the
                     graphics pipeline.

       An alternative to classic instancing is "flattening" which
       creates a clone of the instanced subtree and then applies
       the transformation to all geometry in the cloned subtree.
       This method eliminates the performance problems listed
       above but does increase memory usage.


              pfNode* <B>pfNode::bufferClone</B>(int mode, pfBuffer
              *buf)

       is a version of <B>pfNode::clone</B> which clones the pfBuffer
       and its subtree, which resides in <I>buf</I>, into the current
       pfBuffer. <I>mode</I> is the same argument as that passed to
       <B>pfNode::clone</B> (it is currently ignored). Once cloned, a
       subtree may be flattened with <B>pfNode::flatten</B>.:

       Example 1: Instancing with pfGroup::bufferAddChild



       libraryBuffer = new pfBuffer;
       libraryBuffer-&gt;select();

       loadLibraryObjects();

       pagingBuffer = new pfBuffer;
       pagingBuffer-&gt;select();

       while (!done)
       {
           pfNode     *newStuff;
           pfSCS *treeLocation;

           /* Load new terrain tile or whatever */
           newStuff = loadStuff();

           /* Create pfSCS which is location of tree */
           treeLocation = new pfSCS(treeMatrix);

           /* Add library model of a tree to treeLocation */
           treeLocation-&gt;bufferAddChild(libraryTree);

           /* Add instanced tree to newly loaded stuff */
           newStuff-&gt;addChild(treeLocation);
       }

       libraryBuffer-&gt;select();

       loadLibraryObjects();

       pagingBuffer = new pfBuffer;
       pagingBuffer-&gt;select();

       while (!done)
       {
           pfNode     *newStuff;
           pfSCS *treeLocation;

           /* Load new terrain tile or whatever */
           newStuff = loadStuff();

           /* Create pfSCS which is location of tree */
           treeLocation = new pfSCS(treeMatrix);

           /* Clone tree model from library into current, paging buffer */
           newTree = libraryTree-&gt;bufferClone(0, libraryBuffer);

           /* Transform cloned tree */
           treeLocation-&gt;addChild(newTree);
           treeLocation-&gt;flatten();

           /* Get rid of unneeded treeLocation */
           treeLocation-&gt;removeChild(newTree);
           pfDelete(treeLocation);

           /* Add cloned, flattened tree to newly loaded stuff */
           newStuff-&gt;addChild(newTree);
       }



       <B>pfAsyncDelete</B> is a special version of <B>pfDelete</B> which is
       useful for asynchronous database deletion. Instead of hav-
       ing immediate effect, <B>pfAsyncDelete</B> simply registers a
       deletion request at the time of invocation.  These dele-
       tion requests are then processed in the <B>DBASE</B> trigger rou-
       tine, <B>pfDBase</B> (<B>pfDBase</B> is automatically called if you have
       not registered a <B>DBASE</B> callback with <B>pfDBaseFunc</B>).  Thus,
       if the <B>DBASE</B> processing stage is configured as its own
       process via <B>pfMultiprocess</B>, then the deletion will be car-
       ried out asynchronously without affecting (slowing down)
       the main processing pipelines.

       <B>pfAsyncDelete</B> may be called from any process and returns
       -1 if <I>mem</I> is NULL or not derived from pfMemory and returns
       TRUE otherwise.  Note that unlike <B>pfDelete</B> <B>pfAsyncDelete</B>
       does not check <I>mem</I>'s reference count and return TRUE or
       FALSE indicating whether <I>mem</I> was successfully deleted or
       not. Instead, the reference count check is delayed until
       the next call to <B>pfDBase</B>.  At this time there is no way to
       query the success of an <B>pfAsyncDelete</B> request.

       Note that <B>pfDBase</B> should only be called from within the
       database callback function (<B>pfDBaseFunc</B>) in the <B>DBASE</B> pro-
       cess just like <B>pfCull</B> and <B>pfDraw</B> should only be called in
       static pfGroup **Tiles;
       static int     *TileStatus;

       /*
        * Load new tiles and delete old ones.
        */
       void
       pageDBase(void *data)
       {
           static pfBuffer      *buf = NULL;
           pfGroup         *root;

           if (buf == NULL)
           {
            buf = new pfBuffer;
            buf-&gt;select();
           }

           /* Asynchronously delete unneeded tiles and update their status */
           for (allUnneededTiles)
           {
            /*
                * Scene does not have scope in 'buf' so use pfBufferRemoveChild

            Scene-&gt;bufferRemoveChild(Tiles[i]);

            /* Delete Tiles[i] at pfDBase time if Tiles[i] only has Scene as
               a parent.

            pfAsyncDelete(Tiles[i]);

            /* Update tile status */
            TileStatus[i] = TILE_DELETED;
           }

            */
           LoadNeededDatabaseTiles(Tiles, TileStatus);

            Scene-&gt;bufferAddChild(loadedTile[i]);
           }

            * Merge newly loaded tiles into main pfBuffer then carry out
            * all pfBufferAdd/RemoveChild requests.
            */
           pfBuffer::merge();

           /*
            * Carry out pfAsyncDelete requests. Call *after* pfBuffer::merge()
            * so that all pfBufferRemoveChild requests have been processed

       pfInit();
       Tiles = pfMalloc(sizeof(pfGroup*) * NUM_TILES, pfGetSharedArena());
       TileStatus = pfMalloc(sizeof(int) * NUM_TILES, pfGetSharedArena());
       pfMultiprocess(PFMP_APP_CULL_DRAW | PFMP_FORK_DBASE);
