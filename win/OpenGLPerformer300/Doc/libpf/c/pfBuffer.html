<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A  pfBuffer is a data structure that logically encompasses
       <B>libpf</B> objects such as pfNodes. Newly created  objects  are
       automatically "attached" to the current pfBuffer specified
       by <B>pfSelectBuffer</B>.  Later, any objects created in <I>buf</I>  may
       be merged into the main OpenGL Performer processing stream
       with <B>pfMergeBuffer</B>. In conjunction  with  a  forked  <B>DBASE</B>
       process (see <B>pfMultiprocess</B> and <B>pfDBaseFunc</B>), the pfBuffer
       mechanism  supports  asynchronous  parallel  creation  and
       deletion of database objects.  This is the foundation of a
       real-time database paging system.

       and  <B>pfBufferRemoveChild</B>,  see  the  pfGroup man page).  A
       given pfBuffer should only be current in a single  process
       at  any  given  time.   In  this way, a pfBuffer restricts
       access to a given object to  a  single  process,  avoiding
       hard-to-find errors due to multiprocessed data collisions.
       <B>pfGetCurBuffer</B> returns the current pfBuffer.

       Only <B>libpf</B> objects are subject to pfBuffer access restric-
       tions.   <B>libpf</B>  objects  include  pfNodes such as pfGroup,
       pfGeode and pfUpdatables such  as  pfLODState,  pfChannel,
       pfEarthSky.  <B>libpr</B> objects such as pfGeoSets, pfGeoStates,
       and pfMaterials have no pfBuffer restrictions so they  may
       be  accessed by any process at any time although care must
       be taken by the application to avoid multiprocessed colli-
       sions on these data structures.

       <B>pfMergeBuffer</B>  merges  the  current pfBuffer with the main
       OpenGL Performer pfBuffer.  This main pfBuffer is  created
       by  <B>pfConfig</B>  and  will  resist  deletion  and merging and
       should only be made current in the <B>APP</B>  process  (however,
       it  is  legal to select a different buffer in the <B>APP</B> pro-
       cess).  If  called  in  a  process  other  than  the  <B>APP</B>,
       <B>pfMergeBuffer</B>  will  block  until the <B>APP</B> calls <B>pfSync</B>, at
       which time the <B>APP</B> will merge the  current  pfBuffer  into
       the   main  pfBuffer  and  then  allow  the  process  that
       requested the merge to continue. If  called  in  the  <B>APP</B>,
       <B>pfMergeBuffer</B>  will  immediately execute the merge.  After
       <B>pfMergeBuffer</B> returns, any objects that  were  created  in
       the  current pfBuffer may only be accessed in the <B>APP</B> pro-
       cess when the <B>APP</B> pfBuffer has been selected as  the  cur-
       rent  pfBuffer.   In  other words, the merged pfBuffer has
       been "reset" and its objects now "exist" only in  the  <B>APP</B>
       pfBuffer.  The  addresses of <B>libpf</B> objects are not changed
       by <B>pfMergeBuffer</B>.

       Any  number  of  pfBuffers  may  be  used  and  merged  (-
       <B>pfMergeBuffer</B>)  by  any  number  of  processes  for multi-
       threaded database manipulation, subject to  the  following
       restrictions:


              1.     A  given  pfBuffer  should  be  current (via
                     <B>pfSelectBuffer</B>) in only a single process  at
                     any given time.

              2.     Each  process  which selects a pfBuffer must
                     be <B>fork</B>ed, not <B>sproc</B>ed.

       Specifically, pfBuffer usage  is  not  restricted  to  the
       <B>DBASE</B> process (see <B>pfConfig</B>).

       <B>pfBufferAddChild</B> and <B>pfBufferRemoveChild</B> provide access to
       nodes that do not exist in the current pfBuffer.   Either,
       none, or both of <I>group</I> and <I>node</I> may exist outside the cur-
       rent pfBuffer.  <B>pfBufferAddChild</B>  and  <B>pfBufferRemoveChild</B>
       act  just  like their non-buffered counterparts <B>pfAddChild</B>
       and <B>pfRemoveChild</B> except  that  the  addition  or  removal
       request  is not carried out immediately but is recorded by
       the current pfBuffer. The request  is  delayed  until  the
       <B>pfBufferSet</B> sets the specified child  <I>index</I>  of  a  <I>parent</I>
       node  to the given <I>child</I>. It acts as a replace command but
       uses an index to identify the replaced child. The  current
       implementation  supports  <B>pfBufferSet</B>  only  for setting a
       source array in a <B>pfAlign</B> node.

       In addition to the pfGroup-specific  <B>pfBufferAddChild</B>  and
       <B>pfBufferRemoveChild</B>  routines,  a  pfBuffer allows generic
       list  management  for  pfGroup,   pfGeode,   pfText,   and
       pfPipeWindow   objects.   These   functions,  <B>pfBufferAdd</B>,
       <B>pfBufferRemove</B>,  <B>pfBufferInsert</B>,  <B>pfBufferReplace</B>  can  be
       used  to  manage  a pfGroup's list of pfNodes, a pfGeode's
       list of pfGeoSets, a pfText's  list  of  pfStrings,  or  a
       pfPipeWindow's  list  of  pfChannels  respectively.  These
       routines infer the proper action to take from the argument
       types.  For example, the following code fragment is equiv-
       alent to <B>pfBufferAddChild(group,</B> <B>geode)</B>:


       pfGroup   *group;
       pfGeode   *geode;

       pfBufferAdd(group, geode);


       <B>pfBufferAdd</B>, <B>pfBufferRemove</B>, <B>pfBufferInsert</B>,
       <B>pfBufferReplace</B>, <B>pfBufferSet</B> all act similarly in that
       they do not have effect until <B>pfMergeBuffer</B> is called and
       all parties have been merged into the main OpenGL Per-
       former buffer. They return -1 if the argument types are
       not consistent (e.g., pfBufferRemove(group, geoset)), 0 if
       the request is immediately processed (this happens when
       all parties already have scope in the current pfBuffer),
       and 1 if the request is buffered until the next
       <B>pfMergeBuffer</B>.

       <B>pfBufferScope</B> sets the scope of <I>obj</I> with respect to
       pfBuffer <I>buf</I>. If <I>scope</I> is TRUE, then <I>obj</I> is "added" to <I>buf</I>
       so that when <I>buf</I> is made current (<B>pfSelectBuffer</B>) in a
       process, <I>obj</I> may be accessed through OpenGL Performer rou-
       tines in that same process.  When <I>scope</I> is FALSE, <I>obj</I> is
       "removed" from <I>buf</I>.  <B>pfBufferScope</B>'s primary purpose is to
       move objects between pfBuffers, particularly from the main
       <B>APP</B> pfBuffer into an application pfBuffer typically used
       for asynchronous database manipulations.  In this case the
       object's scope would be set to FALSE in the old pfBuffer
       and TRUE in the new pfBuffer.  It is undefined when an
       object has scope in multiple pfBuffers since this violates
       the multiprocessing data exclusion requirement of OpenGL
       Performer.  <B>pfGetBufferScope</B> returns TRUE or FALSE indi-
       cating the scope of <I>obj</I> in pfBuffer <I>buf</I>.

       When using pfBuffers for database paging, it is sometimes
       desirable to retain certain, common database models
       ("library models") in memory.  Examples are trees, houses,
       and other "culture" which are instanced on paged terrain
       patches. One instancing mechanism is to create the library
       models in one pfBuffer and later use <B>pfBufferAddChild</B> to
       attach the models to scene graphs created in another
                     requests.

              2.     Transformations in the scene graph reduce
                     OpenGL Performer's ability to sort the
                     database (see <B>pfChanBinSort</B>) and matrix
                     operations have some cost in the graphics
                     pipeline.

       An alternative to classic instancing is "flattening" which
       creates a clone of the instanced subtree and then applies
       the transformation to all geometry in the cloned subtree.
       This method eliminates the performance problems listed
       above but does increase memory usage.


              pfNode* <B>pfBufferClone</B>(pfNode *node, int mode,
              pfBuffer *buf)

       is a version of <B>pfClone</B> which clones <I>node</I> and its subtree,
       which resides in <I>buf</I>, into the current pfBuffer. <I>mode</I> is
       the same argument as that passed to <B>pfClone</B> (it is cur-
       rently ignored). Once cloned, a subtree may be flattened
       with <B>pfFlatten</B>:

       Example 1: Instancing with pfBufferAddChild



       libraryBuffer = pfNewBuffer();
       pfSelectBuffer(libraryBuffer);

       loadLibraryObjects();

       pagingBuffer = pfNewBuffer();
       pfSelectBuffer(pagingBuffer);

       while (!done)
       {
           pfNode     *newStuff;
           pfSCS *treeLocation;

           /* Load new terrain tile or whatever */
           newStuff = loadStuff();

           /* Create pfSCS which is location of tree */
           treeLocation = pfNewSCS(treeMatrix);

           /* Add library model of a tree to treeLocation */
           pfBufferAddChild(treeLocation, libraryTree);

           /* Add instanced tree to newly loaded stuff */
           pfAddChild(newStuff, treeLocation);
       }



       Example 2: Instancing with pfBufferClone and pfFlatten


       pfSelectBuffer(pagingBuffer);

       while (!done)
       {
           pfNode     *newStuff;
           pfSCS *treeLocation;

           /* Load new terrain tile or whatever */
           newStuff = loadStuff();

           /* Create pfSCS which is location of tree */
           treeLocation = pfNewSCS(treeMatrix);

           /* Clone tree model from library into current, paging buffer */
           newTree = pfBufferClone(libraryTree, 0, libraryBuffer);

           /* Transform cloned tree */
           pfAddChild(treeLocation, newTree);
           pfFlatten(treeLocation);

           /* Get rid of unneeded treeLocation */
           pfRemoveChild(treeLocation, newTree);
           pfDelete(treeLocation);

           /* Add cloned, flattened tree to newly loaded stuff */
           pfAddChild(newStuff, newTree);
       }



       <B>pfAsyncDelete</B> is a special version of <B>pfDelete</B> which is
       useful for asynchronous database deletion. Instead of hav-
       ing immediate effect, <B>pfAsyncDelete</B> simply registers a
       deletion request at the time of invocation.  These dele-
       tion requests are then processed in the <B>DBASE</B> trigger rou-
       tine, <B>pfDBase</B> (<B>pfDBase</B> is automatically called if you have
       not registered a <B>DBASE</B> callback with <B>pfDBaseFunc</B>).  Thus,
       if the <B>DBASE</B> processing stage is configured as its own
       process via <B>pfMultiprocess</B>, then the deletion will be car-
       ried out asynchronously without affecting (slowing down)
       the main processing pipelines.

       <B>pfAsyncDelete</B> may be called from any process and returns
       -1 if <I>mem</I> is NULL or not derived from pfMemory and returns
       TRUE otherwise.  Note that unlike <B>pfDelete</B> <B>pfAsyncDelete</B>
       does not check <I>mem</I>'s reference count and return TRUE or
       FALSE indicating whether <I>mem</I> was successfully deleted or
       not. Instead, the reference count check is delayed until
       the next call to <B>pfDBase</B>.  At this time there is no way to
       query the success of an <B>pfAsyncDelete</B> request.

       Note that <B>pfDBase</B> should only be called from within the
       database callback function (<B>pfDBaseFunc</B>) in the <B>DBASE</B> pro-
       cess just like <B>pfCull</B> and <B>pfDraw</B> should only be called in
       the pfChannel <B>CULL</B> and <B>DRAW</B> callbacks respectively (-
       <B>pfChanTravFunc</B>).
