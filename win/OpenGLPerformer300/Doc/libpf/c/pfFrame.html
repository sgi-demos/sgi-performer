<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       OpenGL Performer is designed to run at a fixed frame rate.
       The  <I>rate</I>  argument  to  <B>pfFrameRate</B> specifies the desired
       rate in units of frames per second.  The actual rate  used
       is  based  on  the  video  timing of the display hardware.
       <I>rate</I> is rounded to the nearest  frame  rate  which  corre-
       sponds to an integral multiple of video fields.

       For  a  60Hz  video rate, possible frame rates are (in Hz)
       60.0, 30.0, 20.0, 15.0, 12.0, 10.0, 8.57, 7.5,  6.67,  and
       6.0.  These rates would mean that the number of fields per
       frame would range from 1  (for  60Hz)  to  10  (for  6Hz).
       <B>pfFrameRate</B>  returns the actual frame rate used or -1.0 if
       it is called before <B>pfConfig</B>.

       <B>pfGetVideoRate</B> returns the video timing in number of video
       fields per second or -1.0 if it is called before the video
       rate  has  been  determined.   The  OpenGL Performer video
       clock (see <B>pfInitVClock</B>) runs at this video field rate and
       is initialized to 0 by <B>pfConfig</B>.

       An  alternate  way  of  specifying a desired frame rate is
       <B>pfFieldRate</B>.  <I>fields</I> is the number  of  video  fields  per
       simulation  frame.  The corresponding frame rate will then
       be the video field rate (see  <B>pfGetVideoRate</B>)  divided  by
       <I>fields</I>.  <B>pfGetFieldRate</B> returns the number of video fields
       per simulation frame.

       Frame rate is a per-machine metric  and  is  used  by  all
       pfPipes.   It  controls  the rate at which multiprocessing
       pipelines run and affects computed system load and related
       stress  metrics  (see  <B>pfChanStress</B>).  Since frame rate is
       global it follows that all hardware pipelines  used  by  a
       single  OpenGL  Performer application should be genlocked,
       i.e., the video  signals  are  synchronized  by  hardware.
       Otherwise  the  video  signals of the pipes will be out of
       phase,  reducing  graphics   throughput   and   increasing
       latency.   Genlock  is crucial for proper multipipe opera-
       tion and requires some simple,  platform-specific  cabling
       and software configuration through the <B>setmon</B> call.

       Depending  on the phase as is discussed below, <B>pfSync</B> syn-
       chronizes the application  process  with  the  frame  rate
       specified  by  <B>pfFrameRate</B>  (when phase is <B>PFPHASE_LOCK</B> or
       <B>PFPHASE_FLOAT</B>), or to  the  system  rendering  rate  (when
       phase is <B>PFPHASE_FREE_RUN</B> or <B>PFPHASE_LIMIT</B>).  In the first
       case, <B>pfSync</B> sleeps until the next  frame  boundary,  then
       awakens  and  returns  control to the application.  In the
       second case, <B>pfSync</B> sleeps until the draw  process  begins
       rendering a new frame or returns immediately if in single-
       process operation.  <B>pfSync</B> returns the current frame count
       and  should only be called by the application process when
       multiprocessing.

       <B>pfFrame</B> initiates a new frame of OpenGL Performer process-
       ing by doing the following:


              1.   Calls   <B>pfFluxSyncComplete</B>   to  complete  any
                   pfFlux sync groups that are ready for  comple-
                   tion.

              2.   Triggers  all  processing stages that are con-
                   figured as a separate process.

              3.   Inlines all processing  stages  that  are  not
                   configured as a separate process.

              4.   Sets the current flux frame (<B>pfFluxFrame</B>).

              5.   Sets  the  current, global pfCycleBuffer index
                   (see <B>pfCurCBufferIndex</B>)  which  is  guaranteed
                   not to be in use by any other OpenGL Performer

       <B>pfFrame</B> triggers all OpenGL Performer processing stages (-
       <B>APP</B>,  <B>ISECT</B>,  <B>DBASE</B>, <B>CULL</B>, <B>DRAW</B>, and the optional <B>LPOINT</B>).
       If a stage is partitioned into a separate process, <B>pfFrame</B>
       will allow that process to run.  Otherwise, <B>pfFrame</B> itself
       will carry out the processing associated with  the  stage.
       <B>pfFrame</B>  will  directly invoke all user callbacks that are
       in the same process as that which called <B>pfFrame</B>.   Other-
       wise,  a  callback will be invoked by the process of which
       it is a part, e.g., the <B>ISECT</B> callback will be invoked  by
       the  <B>ISECT</B>  process if <B>PFMP_FORK_ISECT</B> is set in the argu-
       ment to <B>pfMultiprocess</B>.

       All OpenGL Performer stage callbacks have a block of asso-
       ciated  data  known as "user data." User data is passed as
       an argument to the stage callback. To simplify  data  flow
       in  a multiprocessing environment, OpenGL Performer copies
       user data into internal buffers and  propagates  the  data
       down  multiprocessing  pipelines. To restrict data copying
       to only those frames in which user data changes,  use  the
       <B>pfPass&lt;*&gt;Data</B>  functions. <B>pfPass&lt;*&gt;Data</B>  signifys that the
       user data has changed and needs to be copied. <B>pfFrame</B> will
       then  copy the data into its internal buffer and the stage
       callback will receive the updated user data.  Stage  call-
       backs and user data functions are listed below.

       center  tab($)  ;  c | c | c | c .  Stage$Callback$Alloca-
       tion$Pass _ APP$pfChanTravFunc$pfAllocChanData$pfPassChan-
       Data$  CULL$pfChanTravFunc$pfAllocChanData$pfPassChanData$

       ISECT$pfIsectFunc$pfAllocIsectData$pfPassIsectData
       DBASE$pfDBaseFunc$pfAllocDBaseData$pfPassDBaseData

       <B>pfFrame</B> triggers the APP, CULL  and  DRAW  stages  of  all
       pfPipes  so it must be called every frame a new display is
       desired.  OpenGL Performer will attempt to cull  and  draw
       all active pfChannels on all pfPipes within a single frame
       period.  Multiple pfChannels on a single  pfPipe  will  be
       processed  in  the  order  they  were added to the pfPipe.
       <B>pfFrame</B> returns the current frame count and should only be
       called by the application process when multiprocessing.

       If   specified,  pfChannel  cull  and  draw  callbacks  (-
       <B>pfChanTravFunc</B>) will be invoked by the appropriate process
       which  may  or  may  not  be  the same process that called
       <B>pfFrame</B>.  If these callbacks are not specified, <B>pfCull</B> and
       <B>pfDraw</B> will be called instead.  pfChannel passthrough data
       which is  passed  to  pfChannel  function  callbacks  (see
       <B>pfPassChanData</B>)  is copied into internal memory at <B>pfFrame</B>
       time.

       If the light points process is used, pfFrame  will  invoke
       the   corresponding   callback   if   one   is  set  using
       <B>pfChanTravFunc</B>.  If no  callback  is  specified,  <B>pfLPoint</B>
       will  be  called  instead. The light points callback share
       the same passthrough as the draw process.

       In typical operation, <B>pfFrame</B> should closely follow <B>pfSync</B>
       in  the  main  application  loop.  Since the <B>CULL</B> does not

       <B>pfFrame</B> will automatically call <B>pfSync</B> if the  application
       did  not  call  <B>pfSync</B> before calling <B>pfFrame</B>.  This means
       the application need not call <B>pfSync</B>.

       It is crucial to keep the time spent  in  the  application
       process  less  than  a frame's time so the system can meet
       the  desired  frame  rate.   If  the  application  process
       exceeds  a single frame's time, <B>pfFrame</B> will not be called
       often enough to meet the frame rate.

       The following code fragment is an example of  an  applica-
       tion's main processing loop:

       Example 1: Main simulation loop.

       pfFrameRate(30.0f);     /* Set desired frame rate to 30Hz */

       while (!done)
       {
           app_funcs();        /* Perform application-specific functions */
           update_positions(); /* Update moving models for frame N */

           pfSync();           /* Sleep until next frame boundary */

           update_view();      /* Set view for frame N */
           pfFrame();          /* Trigger cull and draw for frame N */
       }


       <B>pfAppFrame</B> triggers a traversal that updates the state of
       the scene graph for the next frame.  This includes updat-
       ing the state of pfSequence nodes and invoking APP call-
       backs on nodes in the scene graph.  If <B>pfAppFrame</B> is not
       invoked directly, <B>pfSync</B> or <B>pfFrame</B> invokes it automati-
       cally.  Note that when the view is not set until after
       <B>pfSync</B>, as in the example above, the view point in the
       channel during the application traversal contains the eye
       point from the previous frame.

       <B>pfGetFrameCount</B> returns the current frame count.  The
       frame count is initialized to 0 by <B>pfConfig</B> and is incre-
       mented by each call to <B>pfFrame</B>.

       <B>pfGetFrameRate</B> returns the current system frame rate (pos-
       sibly rounded) previously set by <B>pfFrameRate</B>.  Note that
       this is not necessarily the same as the achieved frame
       rate.

       <B>pfSync</B> synchronizes the application process to a particu-
       lar rate.  This rate may be fixed, for example a steady
       20Hz or may vary with the rendering rate.  In addition,
       the drawing process may be synchronized to either a steady
       or a varying rate.  <B>pfPhase</B> specifies the synchronization
       methods used by <B>pfSync</B> and the drawing process (if it is a
       separate process).  <I>phase</I> is a symbolic constant that
       specifies the phase of all process pipeline(s). It can
       take on the following values:

                   <B>pfSync</B> synchronizes to the next frame boundary
                   but the drawing process can begin drawing and
                   swap its rendering buffers at non-frame bound-
                   aries.

              <B>PFPHASE_FREE_RUN</B>
                   <B>pfSync</B> synchronizes to the rendering rate so
                   the application runs at its peak (and usually
                   non-constant) capability.

              <B>PFPHASE_LIMIT</B>
                   <B>pfSync</B> synchronizes to the rendering rate but
                   the rendering rate is limited to that frame
                   rate specified by <B>pfFrameRate</B>.

       Additionally, the modifier <B>PFPHASE_SPIN_DRAW</B> may be or-ed
       in with the main phase mode from the above list.

       <B>pfPhase</B> is a global mode so all pfPipes in the system are
       forced to run with the same phase.

       If running in locked phase, the drawing process will swap
       buffers only on frame boundaries.  A benefit of locking is
       that such pipelines are self-regulating so synchronizing
       two pfPipes together is simple, even across different
       machines.  Another benefit is that latency is minimized
       and predictable.  The major drawback is that if a view
       takes slightly longer than a frame to render (it has
       'frame-extended'), then an entire frame is skipped rather
       than a single vertical retrace period.  However, if mini-
       mal distraction is crucial, the phase can float so that
       buffer swapping may happen on non-frame boundaries.  In
       this case it is not guaranteed that the windows on pfPipes
       will swap together; they may get out of phase resulting in
       inconsistent images if the displays are adjacent and are
       displaying the same scene.

       The difference between phase lock and phase float becomes
       less apparent with increasing frame rate.  At a rate equal
       to the vertical retrace rate, there is no difference.
       Also, if pfPipes do not 'frame extend', then there is no
       difference.

       Applications which do not require a fixed frame rate may
       use <B>PFPHASE_FREE_RUN</B> or <B>PFPHASE_LIMIT</B>.  <B>PFPHASE_FREE_RUN</B>
       essentially disables OpenGL Performer's fixed frame rate
       mechanisms and will cause the application to run at its
       rendering rate so it slows down when rendering complex
       scenes and speeds up when rendering simple scenes.  In
       this case, the frame rate specified by <B>pfFrameRate</B> no
       longer affects the system frame rate but is still used to
       compute system load and stress.  Additionally, if the APP,
       CULL, and/or DRAW stages are in separate processes, they
       will run in lock step and each stage will wait for the
       downstream stage to get its results and likewise, down-
       stream stages wait for upstream stages to finish.  This is
       the desired mode if you need to be sure that every APP
       frame is actually drawn and that the APP can not spin
       ahead of the draw is slow and extends past its goal frame
       by <B>pfFrameRate</B>.

       <B>PFPHASE_SPIN_DRAW</B> allows forked draw processes to redraw
       the previous frame if an upstream stage slowed down an
       missed a frame.  This only affects locked and float phase
       modes.  The default behavior is without <B>PFPHASE_SPIN_DRAW</B>,
       in which case a forked draw process will wait for new
       results from an upstream stage before continuing.  In
       locked or float modes, the draw process will only check
       for new upstream results on frame boundaries.

       <B>pfPhase</B> may be called any time after <B>pfConfig</B>.

       <B>pfGetPhase</B> returns the current phase. The default phase is
       <B>PFPHASE_FREE_RUN</B>.

       <B>pfFrameTimeStamp</B> sets the time stamp of the current frame
       to <I>time</I>.  The frame time stamp is used when evaluating all
       pfSequences. Normally, <B>pfFrame</B> sets the frame time stamp
       immediately before returning control to the application
       although the application may set it to account for varying
       latency in a non-constant frame rate situation.  Time is
       relative to <B>pfInit</B> when the system clock is initialized to
       0.

       <B>pfGetFrameTimeStamp</B> returns the frame time stamp of the
       current frame.

       <B>pfGetFrameTimeFlux</B> returns the global frame time flux.
       The frame time flux is a pfFlux that is updated with the
       frame time stamp of the current frame whenever it changes.
       By default the frame time flux is configured with the
       <B>PFFLUX_PUSH</B> mode set to <B>PF_ON</B>.  The frame time flux is
       useful for automatically driving pfEngine animations.

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       To achieve a steady frame rate synchronized with the
       graphics display in an otherwise non-graphical applica-
       tion, a screen must be set on the first pfPipe with
       <B>pfPipeScreen</B> and <B>pfFrame</B> should be used in the main loop
       which will indirectly call <B>pfSync</B> to obey the current
       phase.
