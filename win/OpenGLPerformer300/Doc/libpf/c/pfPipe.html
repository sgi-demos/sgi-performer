<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A pfPipe is a software rendering pipeline which renders
       one or more pfChannels into one or more pfPipeWindows. A
       pfPipe can be configured as multiple processes for
       increased throughput on multiprocessor systems. Multiple
       pfPipes can operate in parallel in support of platforms
       with multiple graphics pipelines.  The number of pfPipes
       and the multiprocessing mode used are set by <B>pfMultipipe</B>
       and <B>pfMultiprocess</B> respectively (see <B>pfConfig</B>).

       A pfPipe references one or more pfPipeWindows which in
       turn reference one or more pfChannels. A pfChannel is sim-
       ply a view of a scene which is rendered into a viewport of
       a pfPipeWindow.  A pfPipeWindow is a graphics window man-
       aged by its parent pfPipe.

       pfPipes, pfPipeWindows, and pfChannels form a hierarchy
       with the following rules:


              1.   A screen (i.e. hardware graphics display) can
                   have multiple pfPipes but should only have one
                   drawing to it

              2.   A pfPipe may only draw to one screen

              3.   A pfPipe may render to multiple pfPipeWindows

              4.   A pfPipeWindow belongs to a single fixed
                   pfPipeWindow is culled but not drawn.

       The following is an example pfPipe-&gt;pfPipeWindow-&gt;pfChan-
       nel configuration.

       Example 1:

                                                (not drawn)

       The code: (in application process)

           /* Calls that create the hierarchy: */
           pfPipe          *pipe = <B>pfGetPipe(0)</B>;
           pfPipeWindow    *pwin0 = pfNewPWin(pipe);
           pfAddChan(pwin0, chan1);
           pfAddChan(pwin1, chan2);

           /* Calls that cause the window to be opened at next pfFrame() */
           pfOpenPWin(pwin0);
           pfOpenPWin(pwin1);
           pfFrame();


       If a pfPipe has no windows at the time <B>pfFrame</B> is called,
       a full screen pfPipeWindow will be opened for <I>pipe</I> and all
       pfChannels of <I>pipe</I> will be assigned to that pfPipeWindow.

       <B>pfGetPipeClassType</B> returns the <B>pfType</B>* for the class
       <B>pfPipe</B>.  The <B>pfType</B>* returned by <B>pfGetPipeClassType</B> is the
       same as the <B>pfType</B>* returned by invoking <B>pfGetType</B> on any
       instance of class <B>pfPipe</B>.  Because OpenGL Performer allows
       subclassing of built-in types, when decisions are made
       based on the type of an object, it is usually better to
       use <B>pfIsOfType</B> to test if an object is of a type derived
       from a Performer type rather than to test for strict
       equality of the <B>pfType</B>*'s.

       <B>pfPipeScreen</B> specifies the hardware screen, <I>screen</I>,
       (graphics pipeline) used for rendering by the pfPipe,
       <I>pipe</I>.  The screen of the pfPipe may be specified in the
       application process before the call to open or configure
       any pfPipeWindows (<B>pfOpenPWin</B>, <B>pfConfigPWin</B>) on <I>pipe</I>, or
       may be specified implicitly by the screen of the first
       opened pfPipeWindow.  A pfPipe is tied to a specific hard-
       ware pipeline and the screen of a pfPipe cannot be changed
       once determined.  For single pipe operation, if the screen
       of a pfPipe or pfPipeWindow is never explicitly set in
       single pipe configuration, the screen will be taken from
       the default screen of the current pfWSConnection, or cur-
       rent X Display.  For multipipe operation, if the screen of
       a pfPipe or pfPipeWindow is never explicitly set and
       pfMultipipe() has been used to configure multiple pfPipes,
       then pfPipes will automatically be assigned to hardware
       screens in order, i.e., <B>pfGetPipe(0)</B> -&gt; screen 0, pfGet-
       <B>Pipe(1)</B> -&gt; screen 1, etc.  If a custom mapping of pfPipes
       to screens is desired, the screens of all pfPipes must be
       specified before the configuration of the first pfPipe
       which will happen at the first call to <B>pfFrame</B>.  See the
       <B>pfGetCurWSConnection</B> reference  page for more details on
       how to manage X display connections.

       <B>pfPipeWSConnectionName</B> allows you to specify both a window
       server target and screen for the pfPipe.  This is useful
       for doing remote rendering, or for running on a system
       with multiple window servers. This call should be made in
       the application process, before the first call to pfFrame.
       <B>pfGetPipeWSConnectionName</B> will return the current window
       server target name.  A window server target specified on a
       pfPipe will take precedence over any such targets speci-
       fied on pfPipeWindows of that pfPipe.  If the window
       server target of a pfPipe has not been set, it may be
       implicitly set from the first such setting on a child
       pfPipeWindow.  The window server target of a pfPipe may
       the screen used by <I>pipe</I>.

       For best performance only one pfPipe should render to a
       given hardware pipeline. If multiple views on a single
       screen are desired, use multiple pfChannels, and if neces-
       sary, multiple pfPipeWindows.

       Normally a pfPipe swaps the color buffers at the end of
       each frame.  However, if special control is needed over
       buffer swapping, <B>pfPipeSwapFunc</B> will register <I>func</I> as the
       buffer swapping function for <I>pipe</I>.  Instead of swapping
       buffers, <I>func</I> will be called and will be expected to swap
       the color buffers of the provided pfPipeWindow.
       <B>pfGetPipeSwapFunc</B> returns the buffer swapping function of
       <I>pipe</I> or <B>NULL</B> if none is set.

       If you wish to frame lock multiple pfPipes so that each
       pfPipe swaps its color buffers at the same time, then you
       should create a channel group consisting of one or more
       pfChannels on each pfPipe and make sure <B>PFCHAN_SWAPBUFFERS</B>
       is shared. In addition, separate hardware graphics
       pipelines *must* be genlocked for proper frame-locking.

       <B>pfGetPipePWin</B> returns the pointer to the pfPipeWindow at
       the location specified by <I>which</I> in the pfPipeWindow list
       on <I>pipe</I>.

       <B>pfGetPipeNumPWins</B> returns the number of pfPipeWindows that
       have been created on <I>pipe</I>.  <B>pfGetPipeNumChans</B> returns the
       number of pfChannels that have been created on <I>pipe</I>.

       <B>pfMovePWin</B> moves the specified pfPipeWindow <I>pwin</I> to the
       location specified by <I>where</I> in the pfPipeWindow list on
       <I>pipe</I>.  The move includes removing <I>pwin</I> from its current
       location by moving up the elements in the list that follow
       it and then inserting <I>pwin</I> into its new location.  If <I>pwin</I>
       is attached to <I>pipe</I>, (-1) is returned and <I>pwin</I> is not
       inserted into the list.  Otherwise, <I>where</I> is returned to
       indicate success.  <I>where</I> must be within the range [0 .. n]
       where n is the number returned by <B>pfGetPipeNumPWins</B>(), or
       else (-1) is returned and no move is executed.

       <B>pfGetPipeChan</B> returns the pointer to the pfChannel at
       location <I>which</I> in the list of pfChannels on <I>pipe</I>.

       <B>pfGetPipeLoad</B> returns the current instantaneous load
       (ratio of time required to process a frame and the time
       allotted for that frame's processing) for the pipe.

       <B>pfBindPipeVChans</B> binds all pfPipeVideoChannels associated
       with the pfPipe <I>pipe</I> to the video hardware.
       <B>pfUnbindPipePVChans</B> performs the opposite action, unbind-
       ing each from the video hardware.

       Example 2: How to frame lock pfPipes

       leftChan  = pfNewChan(<B>pfGetPipe(0)</B>);
       rightChan = pfNewChan(<B>pfGetPipe(1)</B>);

   <B>USING</B> <B>PFPIPES</B> <B>TO</B> <B>APPLY</B> <B>INCREMENTAL</B> <B>GRAPHICS</B> <B>STATE</B>
       pfPipe's are also the level at which hardware pipeline
       specific graphics state can be applied.  The only two cur-
       rently supported incremental graphics state elements that
       can be applied on a per-pipe basis are pfMPClipTexture's.
       Both of the libpf primitives provide support for incremen-
       tally paging texture from memory into texture memory which
       contains a texture cache that differs on a per frame
       basis.  Thus by attaching these structures to a pfPipe,
       the pfPipe will provide frame accurate applying and down-
       loading of these texture primitives.  Note that this
       incremental downloading should be attached to a channel
       such that loading statistics can be accumulated.

       <B>pfPipeIncrementalStateChanNum</B> sets the channel with which
       the incremental state should be processed.  If unspecified
       the first channel enabled for drawing will be used to pro-
       cess the incremental state.
       <B>pfGetPipeIncrementalStateChanNum</B> returns the channel with
       which all incremental state attached to the pfPipe will be
       processed.

       <B>pfAddMPClipTexture</B> is used to associate a pfMPClipTexture
       with a particular pfPipe.  This association forces the
       pfPipe to apply the pfMPClipTexture and download the
       resulting incremental texture changes in a frame accurate
       manner. If a pfMPClipTexture is added to a pipe that is
       already connected to another pipe, the function silently
       creates a new pfMPClipTexture, makes it a slave of the
       pfMPClipTexture that is already connected to another pipe,
       and adds the slave to the pipe in place of the one passed
       as an argument to the function.

       <B>pfRemoveMPClipTexture</B> is used to remove the association of
       a pfMPClipTexture from a pfPipe such that the pfPipe will
       no longer manage the incremental application of the pfMP-
       ClipTexture. If a pfMPClipTexture is removed that is the
       master of other pfMPClipTextures, the slaves will be
       removed from their pipes as well.

       <B>pfGetNumMPClipTextures</B> returns the number of pfMPClipTex-
       tures that have been attached to the pfPipe.

       <B>pfGetMPClipTexture</B> returns the <I>which</I>th pfMPClipTexture
       that has been attached to the pfPipe.

       <B>pfPipeTotalTexLoadTime</B> sets the total amount of texture
       download time in (milliseconds) allocated for all the pfM-
       PClipTextures attached to this pfPipe.  This download time
       is used by the pfMPClipTexture's DTR load control system
       to update texture memory as the pfMPClipTexture's center
       is moved.

       The total download time is distributed among the pfMPClip-
       Textures attached to the pfPipe by examining the value of
       each pfMPClipTexture's load time fraction parameter. This
       floating point number is queried from each pfMPClipTexture
       attached to the pfPipe and the results are summed. The
       resulting value used to normalize each pfMPClipTexture's
       return the current value for total texture download time.
       The default value is 6 milliseconds.

       <B>pfGetPipeNum</B> returns the pipeline number for the current
       OpenGL Performer pipeline process. <B>pfGetPipeNum</B> returns
       (-1) if invoked in a process that isn't associated with a
       pfPipe.  Only the CULL, DRAW, and LPOINT processes have
       valid pipe numbers.

       <B>pfGetPipeDrawCount</B> will return the frame count of the last
       draw to complete for the pfPipe. This can be called in the
       application process to find out where the draw is.

       <B>pfGetLastPipeFrameCount</B> will return the frame count of the
       last process associated between ISECT and the DRAW of <I>pipe</I>
       to finish.  This can tell you what processes might be
       using old pfGeoSets in the scene graph.
