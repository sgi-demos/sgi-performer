       The OpenGL Performer class <B>pfVolFog</B> is  derived  from  the
       parent  class  <B>pfObject</B>, so each of these member functions
       of class <B>pfObject</B> are also directly usable with objects of
       class <B>pfVolFog</B>.  Casting an object of class <B>pfVolFog</B> to an
       object of class <B>pfObject</B> is taken care  of  automatically.
       This is also true for casts to objects of ancestor classes
       of class <B>pfObject</B>.

       Since the class <B>pfObject</B> is itself derived from the parent
       class <B>pfMemory</B>, objects of class <B>pfVolFog</B> can also be used
       with   these  functions  designed  for  objects  of  class

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A  pfVolFog is a class that is used to draw the scene with
       fog that has different densities at different locations in
       the scene. The class supports two types of nonuniform fog:
       a layered fog and a patchy fog.

       dimensional  objects  and  its  density is constant inside
       these objects. At the moment all objects specify a  patchy
       fog of the same color and the same density.

       A  pfVolFog  is not part of the scene graph, it is created
       separately by the application process. Once created eleva-
       tion  points  of a layered fog can be specified by calling
       <B>pfVolFogAddPoint</B>  or  <B>pfVolFogAddColoredPoint</B>  repeatedly.
       The   fog   initialization   is   completed   by   calling
       <B>pfApplyVolFog</B>.

       Example:

       pfVolFog *lfog = pfNewVolFog(arena);

       pfVolFogAddPoint(lfog, elev1, density1);
       pfVolFogAddPoint(lfog, elev2, density2);
       pfVolFogAddPoint(lfog, elev2, density2);

       pfApplyVolFog(lfog);


       The boundary of a patchy fog is specified by
       <B>pfVolFogAddNode</B>(<I>pfog</I>,<I>node</I>), where <I>node</I> contains the sur-
       faces enclosing the foggy areas. It is possible to define
       several disjoint areas in the same tree or by adding sev-
       eral different nodes.  Note that each area has to be com-
       pletely enclosed and the vertices of the surfaces have to
       be ordered so that the front face of each surface faces
       outside the foggy area. The node has to be part of the
       scene graph for the rendering to work properly.

       Example:

       pfVolFog *pfog = pfNewVolFog(arena);

       pfVolFogAddNode(pfog, fogNode);

       pfApplyVolFog(pfog);


       Patchy and layered fog can be combined but only if layered
       fog has a uniform color.


       The function <B>pfApplyVolFog</B> initializes a pfVolFog. If at
       least two elevation points were defined it initializes
       data structures necessary for rendering of a layered fog,
       including a 3D texture.  Any control points defined after-
       wards are ignored.  If a node containing patchy fog bound-
       aries has been added prior to calling <B>pfApplyVolFog</B> a
       patchy fog is initialized.  Since function <B>pfVolFogAddNode</B>
       only marks the parts of the scene graphs that specify the
       texture it is possible to add additional patchy fog nodes
       even after <B>pfApplyVolFog</B> has been called.


       A pfVolFog needs information about the current eye posi-
       tion and view direction.  Since this information is not

       If the application changes the position of the patchy fog
       boundaries (for example, by inserting a pfSCS, pfDCS, or
       pfFCS node above the fog node) or the orientation of the
       whole scene with respect to the up vector (for example,
       the use of a trackball in perfly) the fog may not be drawn
       correctly.


       To draw the scene with a fog the draw process has to call
       <B>pfDrawVolFog</B> instead of <B>pfDraw</B>. This function will take
       care of drawing the whole scene graph with the specified
       fog. Expect the draw time to increase because the scene is
       drawn twice (three times if both patchy and layered fog
       are specified). In case of a patchy fog there may also be
       several full-screen polygons being drawn.  You can easily
       disable the fog by not calling <B>pfDrawVolFog</B>.  Since bound-
       aries of patchy fog are in the scene graph do not use
       <B>pfDraw</B> to draw the scene without fog but use <B>pfDrawBin</B>
       with PFSORT_DEFAULT_BIN, PFSORT_OPAQUE_BIN, and
       PFSORT_TRANSP_BIN.

       A patchy fog needs as deep color buffer as possible (opti-
       mally 12-bit per r,g,b) and a stencil buffer. It is recom-
       mended to use at least a 4-bit stencil buffer (1-bit is
       sufficient only for very simple fog objects).  It may be
       necessary to modify your application so that it asks for
       such a visual.

       A pfVolFog can be deleted using <B>pfDelete</B>. In case of a
       layered fog it is necessary to delete the texture handle
       in a draw process. The texture is returned by
       <B>pfGetVolFogTexture</B>.  See example in perf/sam-
       ples/apps/C/fogfly.


       FOG PARAMETERS

       As mentioned above a layered fog of a uniform color is
       specified by function <B>pfVolFogAddPoint</B>, which sets the fog
       density at a given elevation.  The density is scaled so
       that if the fog has density 1 the nearest object inside
       the fog that has full fog color is at a distance equal to
       the 1/10 of the diagonal of the scene bounding box.  The
       layered fog color is set by function <B>pfVolFogSetColor</B> or
       by calling <B>pfVolFogSetAttr</B> with parameter PFVFOG_COLOR and
       a pointer to an array of three floats. The default fog
       color is (0.9,0.9,1).

       A layered fog of a nonuniform color is specified by func-
       tion <B>pfVolFogAddColoredPoint</B>, which sets the fog density
       and the fog color at a given elevation. The color set by
       <B>pfVolFogSetColor</B> is then ignored.

       The layered fog mode is set by function <B>pfVolFogSetVal</B>
       with parameter PFVFOG_LAYERED_MODE and one of PFVFOG_LIN-
       EAR, PFVFOG_EXP, or PFVFOG_EXP2. It is also possible to
       set the mode both for a layered and patchy fog at once by
       using parameter PFVFOG_MODE.  The default mode is PFV-
       has different colors at different elevations a secondary
       scattering is approximated, when the flag PFV-
       FOG_FLAG_FOG_FILTER is set to 1.  In this case the color
       of a higher layer may affect the color of a lower layer.
       If the flag PFVFOG_FLAG_DARKEN_OBJECTS is set even the
       objects below a dense fog become darker. The light is
       assumed to come from the top.

       The size of a 3D texture used by a layer fog can be modi-
       fied by calling <B>pfVolFogSetAttr</B> with parameter PFV-
       FOG_3D_TEX_SIZE and an array of three integer values. The
       default texture size is 64x64x64, but reasonable results
       can be achieved with even smaller sizes. The sizes are
       automatically rounded to the closest greater or equal
       power of 2. The second value should be greater or equal
       than the third value.

       If 3d textures are not supported a set of 2d textures is
       used instead of a 3d texture (the number of 2d textures is
       equal to the third dimension of the 3d texture).  Every
       time r coordinate changes more than 0.1 a new texture is
       computed by interpolating between two neighboring slices
       and the texture is reloaded.  The use of 2d textures can
       be forced by calling <B>pfVolFogSetFlags</B> with flag PFV-
       FOG_FLAG_FORCE_2D_TEXTURE set to 1.

       Once a layered fog is initialized by calling the
       <B>pfApplyVolFog</B> changing any of the above parameters will
       not affect rendering of the layered fog.


       The density of a patchy fog is controlled by function
       <B>pfVolFogSetDensity</B>. It can be also set using
       <B>pfVolFogSetVal</B> with parameter PFVFOG_FOG_DENSITY.  As in
       case of a layered fog the density of a patchy fog is
       scaled by the tenth of the diagonal of the scene bounding
       box.


       The user can specify an additional density value that is
       added to every pixel inside or behind a patchy fog bound-
       ary using the function <B>pfVolFogSetVal</B> with parameter PFV-
       FOG_FOG_DENSITY_BIAS. This value makes a patchy fog appear
       denser but it may create unrealistically sharp boundaries.
       The default value is 0.

       The patchy fog color is set by function <B>pfVolFogSetColor</B>
       or by calling <B>pfVolFogSetAttr</B> with parameter PFVFOG_COLOR
       and a pointer to an array of three floats.  If the
       blend_color extension is not available patchy fog will be
       white.

       The patchy fog mode is set by function <B>pfVolFogSetVal</B> with
       parameter PFVFOG_PATCHY_MODE and one of PFVFOG_LINEAR,
       PFVFOG_EXP, or PFVFOG_EXP2. It is also possible to set the
       mode both for a patchy and layered fog at once by using
       parameter PFVFOG_MODE.  The default mode is PFVFOG_LINEAR.

       The quality and speed of patchy fog rendering can be con-

       Parameters of a patchy fog can be modified any time and
       they will affect the rendering of the subsequent frame. A
       patchy fog can also be animated by modifying the geometry
       of the fog nodes. Make sure that the bounding box of the
       geoset is updated and that <B>pfVolFogAddNode</B> is called every
       time the bounding box is updated.

       The multi-pass algorithms used for rendering layered and
       patchy fog may produce incorrect results if the scene
       graph contains polygons that have equal depth values. To
       avoid such problems a stencil buffer is used during ren-
       dering of the second pass. You can disable this function
       by setting flag PFVFOG_FLAG_CLOSE_SURFACES to 0.

       By default, the multi-pass algorithm is applied only when
       the boundaries of a patchy fog are visible. This may cause
       undesirable changes of semitransparent edges of scene
       objects when fog objects move into or away from the view.
       To force the use of the multi-pass algorithm, call
       <B>pfVolFogSetFlags</B> with flag PFVFOG_FLAG_FORCE_PATCHY_PASS
       set to 1.

       It is possible to use a different algorithm for rendering
       patchy fog that can handle semitransparent surfaces bet-
       ter. To use this algorithm, set flag PFV-
       FOG_FASTER_PATCHY_FOG to 1.

       The faster algorithm also allows the color of patchy fog
       to be modified using a texture. Either a predefined 1D
       texture expressing the attenuation between two elevations
       is used or the user provides a 1D or a 3D texture for each
       volume object. The predefined 1D texture is enabled by
       setting flag PFVFOG_FLAG_PATCHY_FOG_1DTEXTURE. The texture
       is mapped to the range of elevations between the bottom
       and top of the fog bounding box. The texture value at the
       bottom (default 0.3) can be modified by calling
       <B>pfVolFogSetVal</B> with parameter PFVFOG_PATCHY_TEXTURE_BOTTOM
       and the value at the top (default 1.5) using parameter
       PFVFOG_PATCHY_TEXTURE_TOP.  To be able to use a different
       scale for objects of different sizes, the fog objects have
       to be specified separately. When flag PFVFOG_FLAG_SEPA-
       RATE_NODE_BINS is set all calls to <B>pfVolFogAddNode</B> define
       fog nodes that are drawn separately and the predefined
       texture is scaled according to the bounding box of each
       node.  If both flag PFVFOG_FLAG_PATCHY_FOG_1DTEXTURE and
       flag PFVFOG_FLAG_USER_PATCHY_FOG_TEXTURE are set textures
       associated with the fog nodes are used to modify the sur-
       face color of a patchy fog (also only in the faster algo-
       rithm).  To avoid artifacts on overlapping colored patchy
       fog objects a flag PFVFOG_FLAG_DRAW_NODES_SEPARATELY
       forces the algorithm to be applied to each node sepa-
       rately, in the back-to-front order with respect to the
       viewpoint. Currently, this mode does not work well when
       scene objects intersect fog objects.

       If flag PFVFOG_FLAG_LAYERED_PATCHY_FOG is set the layered
       fog is used to define the density and possibly also the
       color of a patchy fog.  The layered fog is then present
       density can be varied using a layered fog.

       Layered patchy fog nodes can be moved and rotated by spec-
       ifying a matrix for each fog node, identified by its index
       (the order in which nodes were specified). A version of
       the function <B>pfVolFogSetAttr</B> with three parameters can be
       used. The first parameter is PFVFOG_ROTATE_NODE, the sec-
       ond parameter specified the node index and the last one is
       a pointer to a pfMatrix.

       Cull programs (see pfCullProgram) can speed up rendering
       of patchy fog because in some draw passes only the part of
       the scene intersecting the fog boundary is rendered. To
       enable cull programs set flag PFVFOG_FLAG_USE_CULL_PROGRAM
       to 1.

       Every set function has an equivalent get function.

       LIGHT SHAFTS

       Light shafts are a special application of a layered patchy
       fog.  The fog boundary specifies a cone of light with
       decreasing intensity (density) along the cone axis. Addi-
       tional rendering passes darken the objects outside the
       cone of light and lit the objects inside the light shaft
       based on their distance from the light.  To enable these
       additional passes set flag PFVFOG_FLAG_LIGHT_SHAFT to 1.
       To ensure that these passes are applied even if the light
       shaft is not in the field of view you have to also set
       flag PFVFOG_FLAG_LAYERED_PATCHY_FOG to 1.

       To control the additional passes the parameter PFV-
       FOG_LIGHT_SHAFT_DARKEN_FACTOR (set using <B>pfVolFogSetAttr</B>)
       can change the factor by which all objects outside the
       light shaft are darkened.  The default value is 0.3.
       Parameters PFVFOG_LIGHT_SHAFT_ATTEN_SCALE and PFV-
       FOG_LIGHT_SHAFT_ATTEN_TRANSLATE set the translate and
       scaling of the one-dimensional texture that is used to
       reduce the color of objects lit by the light. It is recom-
       mended to set the translate to a small value, e.g. 10-20%
       of the shaft length, and the scale to the inverse of the
       shaft length.

       Since light shafts are using a combination of layered and
       patchy fog and the density is decreasing to 0 at the end
       of the light cone the quality of results is very sensitive
       to the depth of color buffers.  12-bit visuals are
       required and the light shaft should not be too large.
       Also make sure that PFVFOG_MAX_DISTANCE is set as small as
       possible.  See program perf/samples/apps/C++/volfog for an
       example of setting up a light shaft.



       HINTS

       A layered fog is faster to render than a patchy fog, thus
       if draw is very slow try to use a layered fog instead of a
       patchy fog. Rendering of both types of fog together is

       You can speed up drawing of a patchy fog by reducing the
       size of the fog boundaries. In case of several disjoint
       fog areas the size of a bounding box containing all bound-
       aries affects the draw time and quality.  Try to avoid
       defining a patchy fog in two opposite parts of your scene.
       Try also to increase the value of <I>resolution</I> (if there are
       not too many overlapping fog boundaries) or reduce the
       patchy fog density.


       If there is a lot of banding visible in the fog try to
       choose a visual with as many bits per color component as
       possible. Keep in mind that a patchy fog needs stencil
       buffer.  You can also try to apply all techniques men-
       tioned in the previous item - reducing the size of patchy
       fog boundaries, increasing <I>resolution</I>, or decreasing den-
       sity.

       If a patchy fog looks incorrect - the fog appears outside
       the specified boundaries - make sure that the vertices of
       the fog boundaries are specified in the correct order so
       that front faces always face outside the foggy area.

       If you see a darker band in a layered fog at the eye level
       make sure that the texture size is set so that the second
       value is greater or equal than the third value.


       LIMITATIONS

       Layered fog:

              The 3D texture coordinates for a layered fog are
              determined at each vertex and interpolated across a
              polygon. Consequently, an object located on top of
              a large ground polygon may be fogged a bit more or
              less than the part of the polygon just under the
              object.

              A layered fog works fast with a 3d texture. Reload-
              ing of 2d textures during the animation can be
              slow.

              When the layered fog is self-shadowed, only a sin-
              gle white light source coming from the top is con-
              sidered.

       Patchy fog:

              The method does not work well for semi-transparent
              surfaces. If your scene contains objects that are
              semitransparent or that have semi-transparent edges
              (for example, tree billboards or mountains in Per-
              former town) these objects or edges may be cut or
              may be fogged more than the neighboring pixels.
              Even if a semi-transparent edge of a billboard is
              outside the fog it will not be smooth.  Set flag
              PFVFOG_FASTER_PATCHY_FOG to use a different algo-
              All areas of a patchy fog have the same color.

              The default algorithm for patchy fog does not work
              with pfEarthSky.


              A layered patchy fog is extremely sensitive to the
              size of the fog area and the density of the layered
              fog. Specifically, the fog values accumulated along
              an arbitrary line crossing the bounding box of the
              fog area should not reach 1.

              A patchy fog needs stencil buffer and as deep color
              buffers as possible.  The rendering quality on a
              visual with less than 12 bits per color component
              is low, unless the fogged area is very small com-
              pared to the size of the whole scene.

              If the blend_color extension is not available the
              patchy fog color will be white.
