<H2>PARENT CLASS FUNCTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The OpenGL Performer class <B>pfIBRtexture</B>  is  derived  from
       the  parent  class <B>pfObject</B>, so each of these member func-
       tions of class <B>pfObject</B>  are  also  directly  usable  with
       objects of class <B>pfIBRtexture</B>.  Casting an object of class
       <B>pfIBRtexture</B> to an object of class <B>pfObject</B> is taken  care
       of  automatically.  This is also true for casts to objects
       of ancestor classes of class <B>pfObject</B>.

       const char*   <B>pfGetUserDataSlotName</B>(int slot);
       int           <B>pfGetNumNamedUserDataSlots</B>(void);

       int           <B>pfDeleteGLHandle</B>(pfObject *obj);


       Since the class <B>pfObject</B> is itself derived from the parent
       class <B>pfMemory</B>, objects of class <B>pfIBRtexture</B> can also  be
       used  with  these  functions designed for objects of class
       <B>pfMemory</B>.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A  pfIBRtexture stores a set of images of a complex object
       as viewed from different directions.  The  directions  are
       specified  using  <B>pfIBRtextureIBRdirections</B>.   Internally,
       pfIBRtexture uses pfDirData to store the views.  pfDirData
       determines  the  type of view distribution.  It could be a
       set of views around the object, all perpendicular  to  the
       vertical  axis.   Or  the  views can be a set of rings and
       each ring contains an array of evenly  spaced  views  that
       have the same angle from the horizontal plane.  Otherwise,
       the views are assumed to be  uniformly  or  randomly  dis-
       tributed  around the sphere of directions.  The directions
       have to be specified before the images are set.

       Once the directions are specified the images are set using
       <B>pfIBRtextureIBRtextures</B>.   The  parameters are an array of
       pointer to the textures containing the views and the  num-
       ber of the textures in this array.

       If  views  are organized in rings the images can be loaded
       directly     from     a     set     of     files     using
       <B>pfIBRtextureLoadIBRtexture</B> without the need to specify the
       directions first.  The parameter <I>format</I> specifies the path
       in  which  the  images  are stored as well as how they are
       indexed, for example,  "images/view%03d.rgb".   The  other
       two parameters specify the number of images and the incre-
       ment between two loaded images (this is  useful  when  the
       texture memory is limited, by specifying <I>step</I>=2 every sec-
       ond image is skipped).
       contain two values at each line - the horizontal angle and
       the  number  of  texture at each ring.  If the file is not
       present in the image directory the directions have  to  be
       specified   before   the  images  are  loaded  by  calling
       <B>pfIBRtextureIBRdirections</B>.  Rings are indexed from  0  and
       should be ordered by the horizontal angle, with the lowest
       angle at index 0.  Each ring can have different number  of
       textures associated with it.

       When rings of views are used the image files read by func-
       tion <B>pfIBRtextureLoadIBRtexture</B> should be indexed  by  the
       ring  index  and  the  index of the image in a given ring.
       The  format  string  should  be  set  appropriately,  e.g.
       "images/view%02d_%03d.rgb". In case the textures are spec-
       ified by the user using <B>pfIBRtextureIBRtextures</B>  the  tex-
       ture  pointers  are all stored in a single array, starting
       with textures of the first ring, followed by  textures  of
       the second ring, and so on.

       It  is  assumed  that the views in each ring are uniformly
       spaced and they are ordered clockwise with respect to  the
       vertical  axis.  If  the views are ordered in the opposite
       direction,    set    the    direction     to     -1     by
       <B>pfIBRtextureDirection</B>.


       At  present,  pfIBRtexture  is  used only by pfIBRnode. It
       provides a draw function for pfGeoSets that belong to  the
       pfIBRnode,  but  the  draw  process  is transparent to the
       user.  The user can control it by setting flags using  the
       function  <B>pfIBRtextureFlags</B>.  If the flag PFIBR_NEAREST is
       set the closest view is selected and applied as a  texture
       of  the  pfGeoSet. This approach is fast on all platforms,
       but it results  in  visible  jumps  when  the  texture  is
       changed.

       Thus  by default the flag PFIBR_NEAREST is not set and two
       to four close views are blended  together,  based  on  the
       distribution  of  the view.  In case of one ring of views,
       two views are blended, in case of several rings  of  views
       four  views  are  blended and in case of uniform or random
       distribution of views 3 views are blended together.

       If the graphics hardware supports register combiners flags
       PFIBR_USE_REG_COMBINERS   and   PFIBR_USE_2D_TEXTURES  are
       automatically set by the class constructor and the  blend-
       ing of textures can be done in one pass.

       On  IRIX, by default the flag PFIBR_USE_2D_TEXTURES is not
       set and a 3D texture is used for fast blending between two
       closest  views.   To  avoid  flickering when the object is
       viewed from a distance additional 3D textures are used  to
       store  additional  mipmap levels This feature is available
       on machines with multisampling only (IR).  To disable  the
       mipmapping,  set flag PFIBR_MIPMAP_3DTEXTURES to zero.  In
       case of several rings, the nearest ring  is  selected  and
       the  views  inside this ring are blended using the 3D tex-
       ture.  3D texture is not compatible with  other  distribu-
       tions  of the views so make sure that in that case you set

       See pfIBRnode man page and program sample/pguide/C++/IBRn-
       ode  for  more  details of how to associate a pfIBRtexture
       with a pfIBRnode.  See also man page for makeIBRimages,  a
       tool for generating views of a specified object.

       LIMITATIONS

       When the flag PFIBR_3D_VIEWS is set 3D textures should not
       be used. This mode is not implemented.

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       When using pfIBRnodes and  pfIBRtextures  in  perfly,  you
       need  an  alpha buffer. If the pfIBRnode is rendered as an
       opaque rectangle try command line parameter  -9  in  which
       case perfly requests a visual with alpha buffer.
