<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A  pfCullProgram  is a class that is used to set up a cull
       program, a sequence of instructions that are executed  for
       each  scene  graph  node and each pfGeoSet during the cull
       traversal.  There can be two separate cull  programs,  one
       for  nodes  and  one for pfGeoSets.  The node cull program
       uses a set of polytopes. Based on the position of the node
       with  respect  to  each  polytope (inside, outside, inter-
       sects) it can determine whether the  node  is  culled  out
       (good  for  occlusion  culling)  or  whether all pfGeoSets
       under this node are  assigned  to  a  specific  bin.   The
       pfGeoSet  cull  program  also  uses a set of polytopes and
       assigns each pfGeoSet to a  different  bin  based  on  the
       position  of the pfGeoSet with respect to each polytope or
       it culls out the pfGeoSet.  The best use of cull  programs
       is  for  occlusion culling or in multi-pass rendering when
       in some passes only parts of the scene have to be rendered
       and  being  able  to assign these part to a bin can reduce
       the rendering time.

       There is always a default pfCullProgram present on pfChan-
       nel.   To  access it, you can call <B>LcpfGetChanCullProgram</B>.
       Then you can set the  program's  instructions,  the  poly-
       topes,  and  enable  the  cull  program  by  setting  flag
       <B>PFCULL_PROGRAM</B> using  <B>pfChanTravMode</B>  (see  pfChannel  for
       pfCullProgramAddPgmOpcode(cullPgm, opcode1, data1);
        ...
       pfCullProgramAddPgmOpcode(cullPgm, opcodeN, dataN);

       pfCullProgramResetPgm(cullPgm, PFCULLPG_NODE_PROGRAM);
       pfCullProgramAddPgmOpcode(cullPgm, opcode1, data1);
        ...
       pfCullProgramAddPgmOpcode(cullPgm, opcodeM, dataM);

       pfCullProgramNumPolytopes(cullPgm, 2);
       pfCullProgramPolytope(cullPgm, ptope1);
       pfCullProgramPolytope(cullPgm, ptope2);



       You can define both node and pfGeoSet cull program at once
       by setting the flag in <B>pfCullProgramResetPgm</B> to
       PFCULLPG_GEOSET_PROGRAM | PFCULLPG_NODE_PROGRAM.


       POLYTOPES

       Cull program polytopes are standard pfPolytopes.  They
       could be used to defined various areas: it could be some
       subset of a view frustum in which the geometry is drawn
       using different attributes, it could be a bounding box
       around some area of interest and so on.

       To initialize cull program polytopes, you set the number
       of polytopes that are used by cull programs using
       <B>pfCullProgramNumPolytopes</B>.  Then create new pfPolytope in
       the shared arena and set it using <B>pfCullProgramPolytope</B>.
       The polytopes are indexed from 0.  Polytopes are shared
       between the node and pfGeoSet cull program, even if they
       are different.


       To modify a polytope of certain index during the simula-
       tion, you get a pointer to the polytope using
       <B>pfGetCullProgramPolytope</B>, modify it, and then call
       <B>pfCullProgramPolytope</B>.



       PREDEFINED CULL PROGRAM INSTRUCTIONS

       A cull program is a set of instructions that operate on
       bins and defined polytopes. Instructions are defined in
       sequence. First, you reset the default program (which con-
       sists of return instruction only) using
       <B>pfCullProgramResetPpgm</B> and then specify each instruction
       by its opcode (<B>pfCullProgramAddPgmOpcode</B>) or directly by
       specifying a function (<B>pfCullProgramAddPgmInstruction</B>).
       Each instruction has associated an integer value, used as
       a parameter for the instruction.

       The cull program starts with the bin that is associated
       with the pfGeoSet and as it is executed it modifies it.
       The output is the new bin assignment.

                   in).


              <B>PFCULLPG_TEST_IS_SUBBIN_OF</B> <B>b</B>
                   Test whether the bin that has been determined
                   up to this point is a subbin of bin <I>b</I>. The
                   result is 1 or 0.  Note that bin <I>b</I> is consid-
                   ered a subbin of itself.


              <B>PFCULLPG_TEST_IS_TRANSPARENT</B>
                   Test whether the pfGeoSet is transparent.  The
                   parameter is ignored. The result is 1 or 0.


              <B>PFCULLPG_TEST_IS_LIGHT_POINT</B>
                   Test whether the pfGeoSet belongs to a light
                   point bin.  The parameter is ignored. The
                   result is 1 or 0.


              <B>PFCULLPG_ASSIGN_BIN_MAYBE</B> <B>b</B>
                   Assign bin <I>b</I> to the pfGeoSet if the result of
                   the last polytope test was <B>PFIS_MAYBE</B>.


              <B>PFCULLPG_ASSIGN_BIN_TRUE</B> <B>b</B>
                   Assign bin <I>b</I> to the pfGeoSet if the result of
                   the last binary test was 1.


              <B>PFCULLPG_ASSIGN_BIN_ALL_IN</B> <B>b</B>
                   Assign bin <I>b</I> to the pfGeoSet if the result of
                   the last polytope test was  <B>PFIS_MAYBE</B> <B>|</B>
                   <B>PFIS_TRUE</B>.


              <B>PFCULLPG_ASSIGN_BIN_ALL_OUT</B> <B>b</B>
                   Assign bin <I>b</I> to the pfGeoSet if the result of
                   the last polytope test was  <B>PFIS_FALSE</B>.


              <B>PFCULLPG_ASSIGN_BIN_FALSE</B> <B>b</B>
                   Assign bin <I>b</I> to the pfGeoSet if the result of
                   the last polytope test was 0.



              <B>PFCULLPG_ASSIGN_BIN</B> <B>b</B>
                   Assign bin <I>b</I> to the pfGeoSet.



              <B>PFCULLPG_ADD_BIN_MAYBE</B> <B>b</B>
                   Assign a subbin of bin <I>b</I> and the existing bin
                   to the pfGeoSet if the result of the last
                   polytope test was <B>PFIS_MAYBE</B>. If the existing
                   bin is -1, the instruction operates as an

              <B>PFCULLPG_ADD_BIN_ALL_IN</B> <B>b</B>
                   Assign a subbin of bin <I>b</I> and the existing bin

                   to the pfGeoSet if the result of the last
                   polytope test was  <B>PFIS_FALSE</B>.


              <B>PFCULLPG_ADD_BIN_FALSE</B> <B>b</B>
                   Assign a subbin of bin <I>b</I> and the existing bin
                   to the pfGeoSet if the result of the last
                   polytope test was 0.



              <B>PFCULLPG_ADD_BIN</B> <B>b</B>
                   Assign a subbin of bin <I>b</I> and the existing bin
                   to the pfGeoSet.



              <B>PFCULLPG_JUMP_MAYBE</B> <B>c</B>
                   Skip next <I>c</I> instructions if the result of the
                   last polytope test was <B>PFIS_MAYBE</B>. If <I>c</I> is
                   negative, go back <I>|c|-1</I> instructions.


              <B>PFCULLPG_JUMP_TRUE</B> <B>c</B>
                   Skip next <I>c</I> instructions if the result of the
                   last binary test was 1.


              <B>PFCULLPG_JUMP_ALL_IN</B> <B>c</B>
                   Skip next <I>c</I> instructions if the result of the
                   last polytope test was  <B>PFIS_MAYBE</B> <B>|</B>
                   <B>PFIS_TRUE</B>.


              <B>PFCULLPG_JUMP_ALL_OUT</B> <B>c</B>
                   Skip next <I>c</I> instructions if the result of the
                   last polytope test was  <B>PFIS_FALSE</B>.


              <B>PFCULLPG_JUMP_FALSE</B> <B>c</B>
                   Skip next <I>c</I> instructions if the result of the
                   last polytope test was 0.



              <B>PFCULLPG_JUMP</B> <B>c</B>
                   Skip next <I>c</I> instructions.

                   the following binary flags:
                   <B>PFCULLPG_CULL_ON_ALL_IN</B>,
                   <B>PFCULLPG_CULL_ON_ALL_OUT</B>, <B>PFCULLPG_CULL</B>,
                   <B>PFCULLPG_TEST_TRANSPARENCY</B>,
                   <B>PFCULLPG_DONT_TEST_TRANSPARENCY</B>,
                   <B>PFCULLPG_TEST_LPOINTS</B>, and
                   <B>PFCULLPG_DONT_TEST_LPOINTS</B>.

                   The first three flags determine whether the
                   node or the pfGeoSet is culled out, optionally
                   based on the result of the last polytope test.
                   In that case any bin assignment made by the
                   cull program is ignored.

                   The last four flags control whether an addi-
                   tional test for the pfGeoSet being transparent
                   or being a light point is performed.  These
                   flags have effect only on the pfGeoSet cull
                   program. If the pfGeoSet is transparent or is
                   a light point, the pfGeoSet is assigned a sub-
                   bin of the transparent bin or the light point
                   bin and the bin resulting from the cull pro-
                   gram.

                   If initially the pfGeoSet has no bin assigned
                   to it, both the transparency and light point
                   tests are performed (to follow the operation
                   of a regular cull traversal).  If those tests
                   are not needed the two DONT_TEST flags can be
                   used.  If the pfGeoSet has initially assigned
                   a bin, the tests are not performed unless the
                   binary flags specify so.

                   If you need to perform any of these two tests
                   earlier, for example, to differentiate bin
                   assignment based on transparency, you can use
                   instructions <B>PFCULLPG_TEST_IS_TRANSPARENT</B> and
                   <B>PFCULLPG_TEST_IS_LIGHT_POINT</B>.


       USER-DEFINED CULL PROGRAM INSTRUCTIONS

       The user may provide his/her own instructions. The
       instruction has to be a function, that takes two parame-
       ters, a pointer to pfCullProgram and and an integer value
       (the instruction parameter). The instruction has to return
       a value by which the instruction counter is increased - 1
       for all instructions except jump instructions. Actually,
       it is possible to write whole cull programs as a single
       user-defined instruction.

       There are two variables user-defined instruction can
       access during the execution of a cull program and there
       are several useful methods they may use. The variables
       are:

              <B>currentResult</B>
                   stores the result of the last polytope test or
                   a binary test.

              <B>pfCullProgramTestPolytope(pgm,n)</B>
                     Test polytope <I>n</I> using the pfGeoSet's bound-
                     ing box <B>bbox</B> or node's bounding sphere.  It
                     is recommended to use this function rather
                     than doing the test directly because the
                     result is often already known by testing the
                     nodes above the current pfGeoSet or node and
                     the test can be avoided.


              <B>pfCullProgramAddBinParent(pgm,b)</B>
                     The cull program keeps the list of parents
                     that identify the current bin (to avoid cre-
                     ating many subbins that may not be needed).
                     This function adds a new parent <I>b</I>, which
                     could be also a subbin.


              <B>pfCullProgramIsSubbinOf(pgm,b)</B>
                     Tests whether the current bin is a subbin of
                     bin <I>b</I>.


              <B>pfCullProgramResetBinParents(pgm)</B>
                     This method resets the list of parents of
                     the current bin.

       For example, the predefined instruction
       <B>PFCULLPG_ASSIGN_BIN_MAYBE</B> can be implemented as:


       int MyAssignBinMaybe(pfCullProgram *pgm, int data)
       {
           if(pgm-&gt;currentResult &amp; PFIS_MAYBE) {
               pfCullProgramResetBinParents(pgm);
               pfCullProgramAddBinParent(pgm, data);
           }
           return 1;
       }



       CULL TRAVERSAL

       To reduce the amount of testing performed for each
       pfGeoSet, each node of the tree is tested against all cull
       program polytopes (only when cull programs are enabled).
       If the test is conclusive, that is the bounding sphere of
       the node is inside or outside of a polytope, children of
       the node are not tested against the given polytope.  It is
       recommended to use the node cull program only to determine
       culling and assign bins only at the pfGeoSet level using
       the pfGeoSet cull program.

       If culling to the view frustum is enabled (flag
       <B>PFCULL_VIEW</B> set in <B>pfChanTravMode</B> - see pfChannel for more
       details) it is done before the cull program is executed.
       In this case pfGeoSets that are not intersecting view
       frustum are culled out and cull program is not executed

       In order to use cull programs for occlusion culling you
       have to choose the occluders in the scene, for example
       walls in a room or the walls of the nearest buldings in a
       city. Then you have to create a polytope around the
       occluder. If it is a rectangle one face for the rectangle
       and 4 faces for edges - 4 planes each defined by the edge
       and the eye. You have to update the polytope or polytopes
       every time the eye or the occluder moves.

       You can find and example of occlusion culling in
       /usr/share/Performer/src/pguide/libpf/C++/occlusionCull.C.
       The sample program also includes a function that for a
       polygon defined by 4 vertices creates a polytope that can
       be used by a cull program to perform occlusion culling.

       At present the polytopes have to be convex. Consequently,
       in case two occluders are touching but their common shape
       is concave they have to be defined as two polytopes. In
       that case the geometry that is occluded by both occluders
       and that spans their common boundary is not culled out. To
       avoid that problem, you can define a convex polytope that
       contains both shapes (a convex hull) and then define con-
       vex cut areas that are not part of the occluders. This way
       you can also add holes in occluders. As long as you start
       with a convex polytope, you can subtract as many convex
       polytops as you need.

       The cull program then looks like:


       PFCULLPG_TEST_POLYTOPE, 0 // convex hull
       PFCULLPG_JUMP_ALL_IN, 1
       PFCULLPG_RETURN, 0        // no cull

       PFCULLPG_TEST_POLYTOPE, 1 // first cutout area
       PFCULLPG_JUMP_ALL_OUT, 1
       PFCULLPG_RETURN, 0        // no cull


       PFCULLPG_TEST_POLYTOPE, N // n-th cutout area
       PFCULLPG_JUMP_ALL_OUT, 1
       PFCULLPG_RETURN, 0        // no cull

       PFCULLPG_RETURN, PFCULLPG_CULL


       See /usr/share/Performer/src/pguide/libpf/C++/occlusion-
       CullConcave.C for an example.
