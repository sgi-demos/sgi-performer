pfvMousePicker(3pf)                           pfvMousePicker(3pf)




</PRE>
<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       <B>pfvMousePicker</B>  -  A  pfvPicker  implementation  that uses
       mouse and keyboard events to determine current  focus  and
       to coordinate user-interaction.


</PRE>
<H2>FUNCTION SPECIFICATION</H2><PRE>
       #include &lt;Performer/pfv/pfvMousePicker.h&gt;

                         <B>pfvMousePicker::pfvMousePicker</B>();

       pfuMouse*         <B>pfvMousePicker::getMouse</B>();

       pfuEventStream*   <B>pfvMousePicker::getEventStream</B>();


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  pfvMousePicker extends the pfvPicker class and may be
       used directly by applications in order to coordinate  user
       interaction with scene elements through mouse and keyboard
       input.

       <B>new</B> <B>pfvMousePicker</B> creates and returns a handle to  a  new
       pfvMousePicker object.

       <B>pfvMousePicker::getMouse()</B> returns a pointer to a pfuMouse
       structure stored within the pfvMousePicker  object,  which
       contains  current  mouse  state  and  is  updated  by pfv-
       MousePicker through function pfuGetMouse.

       <B>pfvMousePicker::getEventStream()</B> returns a  pointer  to  a
       pfuEventStream  structure stored within the pfvMousePicker
       object, which  contains  current  keyboard  state  and  is
       updated by pfvMousePicker through function pfuGetEvents.



</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       pfvMousePicker  objecys  may be used by Performer applica-
       tions that do not use the Display and Input Managers  from
       libpfv.

       For  examples of uses of the pfvMousePicker class, look at
       the       sample       code       in       /usr/share/Per-
       former/src/pguide/libpfv/picker  and  the README file con-
       tained in that directory.
