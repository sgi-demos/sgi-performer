<H2>PARENT CLASS FUNCTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The  OpenGL  Performer class <B>pfvModule</B> is derived from the
       parent class <B>pfvobject</B>, so each of these member  functions
       of  class  <B>pfvobject</B> are also directly usable with objects
       of class  <B>pfvModule</B>.   This  is  also  true  for  ancestor
       classes of class <B>pfvobject</B>.

       virtual int   <B>pfvObject::parseXml</B>(pfvXmlNode*xml);
       virtual int   <B>pfvObject::setXmlField</B>(pfvXmlNode*xml);
       char*         <B>pfvObject::getName</B>();
       void          <B>pfvObject::setName</B>(char*_name);


       Since  the class <B>pfvobject</B> is itself derived from the par-
       ent class <B>pfObject</B>, objects of class <B>pfvModule</B> can also be
       used  with  these  functions designed for objects of class
       <B>pfObject</B>.

       void*   <B>pfObject::operator</B> <B>new</B>(size_t);
       void*   <B>pfObject::operator</B> <B>new</B>(size_t, void *arena);
       void*   <B>pfObject::operator</B>     <B>new</B>(size_t,      pfFluxMem-
                 ory *fmem);
       void    <B>pfObject::setUserData</B>(void *data);
       void    <B>pfObject::setUserData</B>(int slot, void *data);
       void*   <B>pfObject::getUserData</B>(pfObject *obj);
       void*   <B>pfObject::getUserData</B>(pfObject *obj, int slot);
       int     <B>pfObject::getNumUserData</B>();


       Since the class <B>pfObject</B> is itself derived from the parent
       class <B>pfMemory</B>, objects of class  <B>pfvModule</B>  can  also  be
       used  with  these  functions designed for objects of class
       <B>pfMemory</B>.

       void*          <B>pfMemory::getData</B>(const void *ptr);
       pfType *       <B>pfMemory::getType</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::isOfType</B>(pfType *type);
       int            <B>pfMemory::isExactType</B>(pfType *type);
       const char *   <B>pfMemory::getTypeName</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::copy</B>(pfMemory *src);
       int            <B>pfMemory::compare</B>(const pfMemory *mem);
       void           <B>pfMemory::print</B>(uint which,   uint verbose,
                        char *prefix, FILE *file);
       int            <B>pfMemory::getArena</B>(void *ptr);
       void*          <B>pfMemory::getArena</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::ref</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::unref</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::unrefDelete</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::unrefGetRef</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::getRef</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::checkDelete</B>();
       pfvModule  allows  derived  classes  to register callbacks
       with the pfvViewer, and through these a range of different
       features/functionalities can be implemented.  Furthermore,
       when creating applications with multiple worlds or  multi-
       ple  views,  the  action  of  individual  modules  can  be
       restricted to only affect a single world or a single view.
       This is referred to as Module Scoping.

       <B>pfvModule::load(char*className,</B>  <B>char*</B>  <B>dsoName,</B>  <B>pfvXmlN-</B>
       <B>ode*xml)</B>  and   <B>pfvModule::load(char*className,</B>   <B>pfvXmlN-</B>
       <B>ode*xml,</B>  <B>char*</B> <B>dsoName)</B> will attempt to load a new module
       and add it to viewer's module-list.  A ClassName  must  be
       provided.  A dsoName (eg: libfoo.so) may also be provided,
       otherwise dsoName will  be  derived  from  className  like
       this:  sprintf(dsoName,"lib%s.%s",  className,  ext ), ext
       being equal to "so" on IRIX and LINUX,  and  to  "dll"  on
       WIN32.  The  viewer  will  look  for  a  library  with the
       required  name,  trying  the  provided  name  first,  then
       prepending  all  paths  listed in the environment variable
       PFV_MODULE_PATH,  then  prepending  all   paths   provided
       through  pfvModule::setLoadPath (or through XML configura-
       tion file). Finally,  libraries  will  be  looked  for  in
       libpfv  standard  location:  ($PFROOT)/usr/lib/libpfv/3.0.
       The module will be loaded through a C function  that  must
       be defined in the module library. The name of this C func-
       tion is derived by prepending 'pfvLoadModule_' to the mod-
       ule's  className,  For  examples  of pfvModule implementa-
       tions, look at the code and Makefiles for the sample  pfvm
       modules                 in                 /usr/share/Per-
       former/src/pguide/libpfv/viewer/modules/.

       <B>pfvModule::setLoadPath()</B> specifies one or more search path
       locations.  These locations are directories to be searched
       for module libraries by method <B>pfvModule::load</B>. Note  that
       search  path  specified  through  the environment variable
       PFV_MODULE_PATH take precedence over the path specified by
       <B>pfvModule::setLoadPath()</B>.

       <B>pfvModule::getLoadPath()</B>  returns  the current search path
       for  module  libraries,  as  set  by  the  last  call   to
       <B>pfvModule::setLoadPath()</B>.

       <B>pfvModule::getScope()</B>  will  return  an integer indicating
       how   module   is   scoped.     Possible    values    are:
       PFV_SCOPE_GLOBAL (module is scoped globally, the default),
       PFV_SCOPE_VIEW (module is scoped to  a  single  view),  or
       PFV_SCOPE_WORLD  (module  is scoped to a single world). If
       module has not yet been attached  to  the  viewer  through
       method <B>pfvViewer::addModule</B>, this method will return 0.

       If  module  is scoped to a world, <B>pfvModule::getScopeIndex</B>
       will return the index of target  world.  If  a  module  is
       scoped to a view, <B>pfvModule::getScopeIndex</B> will return the
       index of target view. If module has not yet been  attached
       to  the  viewer through method <B>pfvViewer::addModule</B>, or if
       module is globally scoped, this method will return -1.

       If     module     is     scoped      to      a      world,
       <B>pfvModule::getScopeTarget()</B>  will  return a pointer to the
       callback   functions   that  will  be  dispatched  by  the
       pfvViewer from a number of entry points  in  various  pro-
       cesses throughout the life of the application.

       <B>pfvModule::bindCallback()</B>  adds  the  callback  associated
       with index 'which' to the list  of  active  callbacks  for
       this module.

       <B>pfvModule::unbindCallback()</B>  removes  the callback associ-
       ated with index 'which' from the list of active  callbacks
       for this module.

       The following callbacks may be bound by a module:


        PFV_CB_PRECONFIG
        PFV_CB_POSTCONFIG
        PFV_CB_SYNC
        PFV_CB_FRAME
        PFV_CB_PRECULL
        FV_CB_POSTCULL
        PFV_CB_PREDRAW
        PFV_CB_POSTDRAW
        PFV_CB_OVERLAY
        PFV_CB_ENTER_VIEW
        PFV_CB_EXIT_VIEW
        PFV_CB_ENTER_WORLD
        PFV_CB_EXIT_WORLD



       <B>pfvModule::getCBMask()</B> returns a 64-bit mask indicating
       which callbacks are currently bound to module. Each call-
       back is associated with a bit in mask.  For example, call-
       back PFV_CB_PRECULL corresponds to bit (1&lt;&lt;PFV_CB_PRECULL)

       If a module has bound its PFV_CB_PRECONFIG callback, the
       <B>pfvModule::preConfig()</B> method will be called by the
       pfvViewer in the APP process, from within pfvViewer::con-
       fig method, just before calling pfDisplayMngr::preConfig()
       and pfConfig().

       If a module has bound its PFV_CB_POSTCONFIG callback, the
       <B>pfvModule::postConfig()</B> method will be called by the
       pfvViewer in the APP process, from within pfvViewer::con-
       fig method, after calling pfConfig().

       If a module is scoped to a pfvWorld and has bound its
       PFV_CB_ENTER_VIEW callback, the <B>pfvModule::enterView()</B>
       method will be called by the pfvViewer in the APP process
       from within pfvViewer::frame, to indicate that module's
       target world will be viewed by a new view on next frame.
       A world-scoped module may receive more than one call to
       this method on a particular frame if more than one view
       are directed to target world on same frame.  Note that a
       handle to the pfvView being entered is passed as an argu-
       ment to <B>pfvModule::enterView()</B>.

       If a module is scoped to a pfvWorld and has bound its
       frame.  Note that a handle to the pfvView being exited is
       passed as an argument to <B>pfvModule::exitView()</B>.

       If a module is scoped to a pfvView and has bound its
       PFV_CB_ENTER_WORLD callback, the <B>pfvModule::enterWorld()</B>
       method will be called by the pfvViewer in the APP process
       from within pfvViewer::frame, to indicate that module's
       target view will be viewing a new pfvWorld on next frame.
       No more than one call to this method may be received by
       any view-scoped module on any one frame.

       If a module is scoped to a pfvView and has bound its
       PFV_CB_EXIT_WORLD callback, the <B>pfvModule::exitWorld()</B>
       method will be called by the pfvViewer in the APP process
       from within pfvViewer::frame, to indicate that module's
       target view will no longer be viewing a certain pfvWorld
       on next frame. No more than one call to this method may be
       received by any view-scoped module on any one frame.

       If a module has bound its PFV_CB_SYNC callback, the
       <B>pfvModule::sync()</B> method will be called by the pfvViewer
       in the APP process from within pfvViewer::sync.  Note that
       if pfvViewer::sync is not called directly by the applica-
       tion, it will automatically be called by pfvViewer::frame
       on each frame.  SYNC callbacks should only be used for
       latency critical tasks (such as for example updating
       tracking device input). See man page for pfSync for more
       info.  Note that SYNC callbacks (as with other run-time
       module callbacks) will not be dispatched for modules which
       are scoped to a pfvWorld that is not being viewed by any
       visible view.

       If a module has bound its PFV_CB_FRAME callback, the
       <B>pfvModule::frame()</B> method will be called by the pfvViewer
       in the APP process from within pfvViewer::frame, after all
       EXIT* and ENTER* callbacks have been dispatched.  FRAME
       callbacks is where most run-time processing is expected to
       be carried out.  Note that FRAME callbacks (as with other
       run-time module callbacks) will not be dispatched for mod-
       ules which are scoped to a pfvWorld that is not being
       viewed by any visible view.

       If a module has bound its PFV_CB_PRECULL callback, the
       <B>pfvModule::preCull()</B> method will be called by the
       pfvViewer in a CULL process just before calling pfCull()
       for a channel.

       If a module has bound its PFV_CB_POSTCULL callback, the
       <B>pfvModule::postCull()</B> method will be called by the
       pfvViewer in a CULL process just after calling pfCull()
       for a channel.

       Globally scoped modules will receive PRECULL and POSTCULL
       callbacks from all channels in pfvViewer's channel-list.
       View-scoped modules will receive PRECULL and POSTCULL
       callbacks from all channels in target-view channel list,
       but not from channels belonging to other views.  World-
       scoped modules will receive PRECULL and POSTCULL callbacks
       from all channels belonging to any view which is currently
       If a module has bound its PFV_CB_POSTDRAW callback, the
       <B>pfvModule::postDraw()</B> method will be called by the
       pfvViewer in a DRAW process just after calling pfDraw()
       for a channel.

       Globally scoped modules will receive PREDRAW and POSTDRAW
       callbacks from all channels in pfvViewer's channel-list.
       View-scoped modules will receive PREDRAW and POSTDRAW
       callbacks from all channels in target-view channel list,
       but not from channels belonging to other views.  World-
       scoped modules will receive PREDRAW and POSTDRAW callbacks
       from all channels belonging to any view which is currently
       viewing target-world.


       After rendering 3D scene and dispatching POSTDRAW call-
       backs, the pfvViewer will set up an orthogonal frustum
       suitable for 2D overlay rendering, and will dispatch OVER-
       LAY callbacks for modules which have bound their
       PFV_CB_OVERLAY callback.  As with other CULL and DRAW
       callbacks, the <B>pfvModule::overlay()</B> method will be called
       depending on module scope.  Globally scoped modules will
       receive OVERLAY callbacks from all channels in pfvViewer's
       channel-list.  View-scoped modules will receive OVERLAY
       callbacks from all channels in target-view channel list,
       but not from channels belonging to other views.  World-
       scoped modules will receive OVERLAY callbacks from all
       channels belonging to any view which is currently viewing
       target-world.

       Note that in order to coordinate 2D rendering over multi-
       channel views, each channel may be assigned a 2d interval
       (referred to as the channel's view-range, see man page for
       pfvDispChan::setViewRange). Before dispatching OVERLAY
       callbacks for a channel, pfvViewer will setup ortho pro-
       jection such that channel's view-range will map exactly to
       channel's viewport.

       Modules can also register a keyboard-input callback to
       respond to key down events. Any combination of keys can be
       declared active for each module through the following
       methods:

       <B>pfvModule::bindKeys()</B> will add all characters contained in
       the keys string to the list of active keys held for mod-
       ule. (see man page for pfvInputMngrCallback)

       <B>pfvModule::unbindKeys()</B> will remove all characters con-
       tained in the keys string from the list of active keys
       held for module.

       <B>pfvModule::getEventMask()</B> will return a pointer to a
       string containing all currently keys for module. Note that
       returned string is guaranteed to be sorted, and to have no
       duplications.

       <B>pfvModule::setEventMask()</B> will set the list of active keys
       for a module.  Note that provided string will be sorted
       and multiple references will be eliminated automatically.

       A module is said to be associated with a view, if bit cor-
       responding to view is set in the mask value returned by
       <B>pfvModule::getViewMask()</B>.  The bit corresponding to any
       pfvView v is given by 1&lt;&lt;(v-&gt;getIndex()).

       Globally scoped modules are associated with all views
       throughout the lifetime of the application. View-scoped
       modules are only associated with their target-view, while
       World-scoped modules will be associated with all views
       that are currently viewing target-world.
