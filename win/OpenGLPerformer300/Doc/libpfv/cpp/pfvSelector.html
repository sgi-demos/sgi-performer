<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  pfvSelector class extends the pfvInteractor class and
       is used in conjunction with pfvPicker  objects  in  imple-
       menting  application-specific user-interaction.  pfvSelec-
       tors differ from pfvInteractors in that they are  able  to
       request  and  enter SELECT state. when a pfvSelector is in
       SELECT state, it is referred to as  the  picker's  current
       selector and plays a major role in the control of all user
       interaction.

       Instances of pfvSelector objects are not  expected  to  be
       created   by  applications;  instead  applications  should
       derive their own classes from pfvSelector,  and  implement
       Alternatively, this can happen if  method  pfvPicker::set-
       State  or pfvPicker::grantRequest were called with request
       state including PFPICKER_SELECT, and  a  pointer  to  this
       selector as the requested selector.

       Once  in  SELECT  mode,  selector  will  receive  calls to
       <B>pfvSelector::updateSelection</B>  at  least  once  every  time
       pfvPicker::update  is  called (usually once per frame). If
       events have been collected by picker, they will be sent to
       selector      as      the      event      parameter     to
       <B>pfvSelector::updateSelection</B>. The req parameter points  to
       a  pfvPickerRequest structure initialized to picker's cur-
       rent state, which can be modified by selector in order  to
       request a new picker state.

       Note  that  while in SELECT state, selector can also allow
       other pfvInteractors to enter HLITE state, or  to  respond
       to  FOCUS_EVENTS, and even to enter INTERACT state without
       selector losing its SELECT state.

       <B>pfvSelector::endSelection</B>  is  called  by  the  picker  to
       notify  selector  that it must exit its SELECT state. This
       will   happen    if    method    pfvPicker::setState    or
       pfvPicker::grantRequest were called, requesting a deselec-
       tion, or the selection of a different pfvSelector.

       <B>pfvSelector::startManip</B> is called by the picker  in  order
       to  offer selector a chance to accept MANIP state. Usually
       this will happen in response to a request made by selector
       itself   through   methods  updateHlite,  specialFocus  or
       updateSelection.  Alternatively, this can happen if method
       pfvPicker::setState or pfvPicker::grantRequest were called
       with request state including PFPICKER_MANIP, and a pointer
       to this selector as requested selector.

       <B>pfvSelector::updateManip</B>  is  called  by picker instead of
       updateSelection while selector is in  MANIP  state.  MANIP
       state  for  a  pfvSelector is much like the INTERACT state
       for an pfvInteractor and it  is  usually  associated  with
       carrying  out an interaction over a number of frames, such
       as dragging a slider.

       While in MANIP state, no other interactor  is  allowed  to
       interfere  with selector, thus HLITE or FOCUS_EVENT states
       will not be allowed.

       <B>pfvSelector::getPermissions</B> is called by the  picker  when
       selector  is  in SELECT state in order to obtain a permis-
       sion mask that will be passed on to other  pfvInteractors.
       Picker calls <B>pfvSelector::getPermissions</B> in several situa-
       tions: When picker is about to offer HLITE  state  to  the
       interactor  associated  with  the  geometry  under current
       focus,  when  picker  is   about   to   call   pfvInterac-
       tor::updateHlite  or  pfvInteractor::updateInteraction for
       picker's current interactor, when picker is about to  call
       pfvInteractor::specialFocus  in order to offer an event to
       interactor associated  with  the  geometry  under  current
       focus.

       The  following methods are intended to make it possible to
       join multiple pfvSelector objects in  multiple-selections.
       However,  the  use  of these methods is not recommended as
       they are likely to be modified  or  eliminated  in  future
       releases:

       <B>pfvSelector::toggleSelection</B>,  <B>pfvSelector::joinSelection</B>,
       <B>pfvSelector::manageSelection</B>,      <B>pfvSelector::getMaster</B>,
       <B>pfvSelector::getSlaves</B>

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       For  examples  of  uses  of the pfvPicker API, look at the
       sample          code          in           /usr/share/Per-
       former/src/pguide/libpfv/picker  and  the README file con-
       tained in that directory.
