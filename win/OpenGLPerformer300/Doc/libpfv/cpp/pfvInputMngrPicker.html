<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       <B>pfvInputMngrPicker</B>  - A pfvPicker implementation that uses
       mouse and keyboard events collected by the pfvInputMngr to
       determine  current  focus  and to coordinate user-interac-
       tion.


</PRE>
<H2>FUNCTION SPECIFICATION</H2><PRE>
       #include &lt;Performer/pfv/pfvXml.h&gt;

                         <B>pfvInputMngrPicker::pfvInputMngrPicker</B>();

       int               <B>pfvInputMngrPicker::getViewIndex</B>();

       void              <B>pfvInputMngrPicker::setViewIndex</B>(int i);

       pfuMouse *        <B>pfvInputMngrPicker::getMouse</B>();

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <B>pfvInputMngrPicker</B> extends the pfvPicker class and may
       be  used  directly  by applications in order to coordinate
       user interaction with scene  elements  through  mouse  and
       keyboard  input.   pfvInputMngrPickers are very similar to
       pfvMousePickers. The only difference is that pfvMousePick-
       ers  calls  pfuGetMouse and pfuGetEvents to collect events
       and current mouse state, while pfvInputMngrPickers  relies
       on  pfvInputMngr to call pfuGetMouse and pfuGetEvents, and
       obtains its input from  the  pfuMouse  and  pfuEventStream
       structures managed by pfvInputMnger.

       <B>new</B>  <B>pfvInputMngrPicker</B>  creates and returns a handle to a
       new pfvInputMngrPicker object.

       <B>pfvInputMngrPicker::setViewIndex</B>  associates  this  picker
       with  the  ith view in Display Manager's view list. Picker
       will ignore events  generated  while  other  views  detain
       mouse focus.

       <B>pfvInputMngrPicker::getViewIndex</B>  returns the index of the
       view to which picker is associated, as set through  method
       <B>pfvInputMngrPicker::setViewIndex</B>.

       <B>pfvInputMngrPicker::getMouse</B> returns a pointer to the pfu-
       Mouse structure used by  picker  for  determining  current
       mouse  state.  Note  that  this will point directly to the
       pfuMouse structure managed and updated by  the  pfvInputM-
       ngr.

       <B>pfvInputMngrPicker::getEventStream</B>  returns  a  pointer to
       the pfuEventStream structure used by picker  for  tracking
       keyboard  events.   Note  that this will point directly to
       the pfuEventStream structure managed and  updated  by  the
       focus, or if focus channel belongs  to  a  view  different
       from  that  associated  with  picker,  this method returns
       NULL.

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       For examples of uses of the pfvPicker  API,  look  at  the
       sample           code          in          /usr/share/Per-
       former/src/pguide/libpfv/picker and the README  file  con-
       tained in that directory.

       For  an  example  of usage of the pfvInputMngrPicker class
       also look at the source code for the pfvmPicker module  in
       /usr/share/Performer/src/pguide/libpfv/viewer/mod-
       ules/pfvmPicker
