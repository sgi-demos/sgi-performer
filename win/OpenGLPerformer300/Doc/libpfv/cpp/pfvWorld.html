<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The pfvWorld class is used to represent the contents of  a
       scene in a pfvViewer application. In addition to having an
       associated pfScene, a  pfvWorld  will  manage  a  list  of
       scoped pfvModules.

       A  pfvWorld object cannot be created through its construc-
       tor (which is private). Instead, a pfvWorld must  be  cre-
       ated through the pfvViewer::createWorld method.

       During  the  course  of  an  application a pfvWorld may be
       viewed by a number of views, and possibly by more than one
       view simoultaneously.

       <B>pfvWorld::getNumViews()</B>  will  return  the number of views
       currently viewing world. Note  that  this  number  is  not
       updated      immediately      after      a     call     to
       <B>pfvView::setTargetWorld()</B>, but will be updated at the  end
       of  the  current  frame, when pfvViewer carries out actual
       switching (see man page for pfvView).

       <B>pfvWorld::getView</B> returns the ith view  in  world's  view-
       list, if i is a valid index, or NULL otherwise.

       <B>pfvWorld::getScene()</B>  returns  a  pointer  to  the pfScene
       object associated to a pfvWorld. Since pfScene  object  is
       created  by pfvViewer::config, this method returns NULL if
       called before modules' POSTCONFIG callbacks are called.

       <B>pfvWorld::addNode()</B> adds node to pfScene  associated  with
       world.   This  method  must be called after pfConfig() has
       been called (by viewer), ie no sooner than modules'  POST-
       CONFIG  callbacks.

       <B>pfvWorld::getViewMask()</B>  returns  a 64-bit mask indicating
       which views are currently viewing  this  world.   The  bit
