<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The pfvView class extends the pfvDispView class  by  being
       able  to be directed to a pfvWorld, and by managing a list
       of  scoped  pfvModules.   Additionally,  geometry  can  be
       assigned to pfvViews (as opposed to assigning it to a pfv-
       World), in order to achieve complex  multiview  configura-
       tions.

       A pfvView object cannot be created through its constructor
       (which is private). Instead, a  pfvView  must  be  created
       through  the pfvViewer::createView method. Note that since
       class pfvViewer is derived from pfDisplayMngr, and create-
       View  is  a  virtual  method  on  class pfDisplayMngr, the
       return pointer for createView is pfDispView*, even if view
       is  actually a pfvView. Casting the returned pointer takes
       care of this, as shown below:

       Eg:

         pfvViewer* viewer = new pfvViewer;
         pfvView* view = (pfvView*)(viewer-&gt;createView());


       A pfvView must be directed to a pfvWorld for viewing
       before the first call to pfvViewer::frame. If this is not
       done explicitly, pfvViewer will direct view to world0
       For this reason, pfvView objects hold two pointers to pfv-
       World: one is the current world (ie the world that view is
       viewing this frame), the other one is the target world
       (world that will be viewed next frame).

       <B>pfvView::getCurWorld()</B> returns a pointer to view's current
       world, while <B>pfvView::getTargetWorld()</B> returns a pointer
       to the pfvWorld scheduled to be viewed by view on next
       frame.

       When a new view is created, both its current world and its
       target world pointers are set to NULL.

       A view is then directed to a pfvWorld by calling
       <B>pfvView::setTargetWorld()</B>.

       As this world switch will be cached until the start of
       next frame, the pointer returned by <B>pfvView::getCurWorld()</B>
       will not change immediately after calling
       <B>pfvView::setTargetWorld()</B>.

       Method <B>pfvView::getTargetWorld()</B> however, will return a
       pointer to the world scheduled to be viewed by view on
       next frame, and this will change immediately after a call
       to <B>pfvView::setTargetWorld()</B>.

       It is also legal to direct a pfvView to a pfvWorld that
       has not yet been created, by providing the target world's
       name thorough method <B>pfvView::setTargetWorld(char*wName)</B>.
       The world name will be stored until pfvViewer::config is
       called, by which time a pfvWorld is expected to exist with
       the specified name.

       Note that <B>pfvView::setTargetWorld(int</B> <B>wIndex)</B> can also be
       used to set target world, but index must be valid at the
       time of this call, and an invalid index will not be
       cached.

       <B>pfvView::autoPos()</B> computes new eye position based on the
       position and size of the geometry currently being viewed
       by view. Note that auto-positioning of eye will happen by
       default on first frame for all views for which an eye
       point was not set explicitely.

       <B>pfvView::addNode()</B> allows geometry to be associated with a
       specific view (instead of with a pfvWorld). view-geometry
       is intended to be visible in channels belonging to this
       view only, even when other views are viewing the same pfv-
       World. This is achieved through the pfvSetNodeChanMask
       function declared in pfvDisplay.h. Note that this method
       cannot be called before modules' POSTCONFIG callbacks are
       called by viewer.

       <B>pfvView::getRootNode()</B> returns a pointer to the group node
       to which all geometry assigned to a view through
       <B>pfvView::addNode()</B> is added.  This node is created by
       pfvViewer just before modules' POSTCONFIG callbacks are
       called, so this method will return NULL until then.
