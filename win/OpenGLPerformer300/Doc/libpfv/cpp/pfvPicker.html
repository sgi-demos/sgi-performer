       <B>pfvPicker::getState()</B> returns the current state of picker.
       Returned  value  is a bitmask. The following bits could be
       set:

       PFPICKER_ALLOW_HLITE indicates that hliting  is  currently
       ON.  ie, the picker will determine which scene element has
       current focus by carrying out intersection tests on  every
       frame. The pfvInteractor associated with the picked geome-
       try will be given a chance to accept hlite state.

       PFPICKER_FOCUS_EVENT indicates that hliting  is  currently
       OFF,  and  picker will not carry out intersection tests on
       each frame unless events have  been  generated,  in  which
       case an intersection test will determine which geometry is
       currently in focus, and events will be sent to the  pfvIn-
       teractor associated with such geometry.

       PFPICKER_HLITE  indicates  that some pfvInteractor is cur-
       rently detaining hlited status. A handle to this pfvInter-
       actor      can      be     obtained     through     method
       <B>pfvPicker::getCurInteractor()</B>.

       PFPICKER_INTERACT indicates  that  some  pfvInteractor  is
       currently  carrying out interaction. A handle to this pfv-
       Interactor    can    be    obtained     through     method
       <B>pfvPicker::getCurInteractor()</B>.

       PFPICKER_SELECT  indicates  that  some pfvSelector is cur-
       rently managing object selection. A handle to this  pfvSe-
       lector      can     be     obtained     through     method
       <B>pfvPicker::getCurSelector()</B>.

       PFPICKER_MANIP that some pfvSelector is currently carrying
       out  interaction while managing object selection. A handle
       to  this  pfvSelector  can  be  obtained  through   method
       <B>pfvPicker::getCurSelector()</B>.

       <B>pfvPicker::printState()</B> prints out a list of tokens repre-
       senting current picker state and may be  used  for  debug-
       ging.

       <B>pfvPicker::getScene()</B>  returns  a  handle  to  the pfScene
       associated with picker.

       <B>pfvPicker::setScene()</B> associates a pfScene to picker. This
       is  the scene that will be traversed by picker in order to
       determine which scene elements and corresponding pfvInter-
       actors have current focus.

       <B>pfvPicker::getChannel()</B>  returns a handle to the pfChannel
       associated with picker.

       <B>pfvPicker::setChannel()</B>  associates  pfChannel  _chan   to
       picker.   Note  that  pfScene  associated with picker will
       automatically be  updated  to  be  equal  to  the  pfScene
       returned by _chan-&gt;getScene.

       <B>pfvPicker::setNodeDataSlot(int</B>    <B>slot_index)</B>   associates
       picker  with userslot with name slot_name. This means that
       when a pfNode is  found  to  be  under  current  focus,  a
       pointer  to  pfvInteractor  will  be  looked for at node's
       userslot with name  slot_name  (see  man  page  for  pfOb-
       ject::getNamedUserDataSlot).  Note  that this method looks
       up and stores the slot index associated with slotname.  If
       a slot name with such name does not exist, it will be cre-
       ated by this call.

       <B>pfvPicker::getNodeDataSlot()</B> returns the slot index  asso-
       ciated  with  picker.  If  no  data slot has been assigned
       through <B>pfvPicker::setNodeDataSlot</B>,  this  method  returns
       -1.

       <B>pfvPicker::update</B>  instructs  picker to carry out its per-
       frame   functionality.   If   picker's   state    includes
       PFPICKER_ALLOW_HLITE,  picker  will  start  by determining
       which pfNode has current focus, and will dispatch endHlite
       and  startHlite callbacks to pfvInteractors falling out of
       and into focus respectively.

       Note that if picker's state also includes PFPICKER_SELECT,
       current selector will be asked to grant permissions before
       other pfvInteractors will be offered  the  opportunity  to
       hlite. This is done through method pfvSelector::getPermis-
       sions. (see man page for pfvSelector).

       After dealing with hlite updates, picker will examine  the
       list  of  events  that  have been collected since the last
       call to <B>pfvPicker::update</B>.  Events are  collected  through
       the virtual method pfvPicker::collectEvents, thus the type
       of events collected by picker depends on the actual picker
       implementation. (see man pages for pfvMousePicker and pfv-
       InputMngrPicker for two  examples  of  picker  implementa-
       tions).   If  no  events have been collected, a NULL event
       will be added to event list.

       The list of collected events is  then  examined,  and  for
       each event, picker will do the following:

       if  picker  state includes PFPICKER_MANIP, event is passed
       on to current selector through pfvSelector::updateManip,

       else if picker state includes PFPICKER_INTERACT, event  is
       passed   on  to  current  interactor  through  pfvInterac-
       tor::updateInteraction.

       else if picker state  includes  PFPICKER_HLITE,  event  is
       passed   on  to  current  interactor  through  pfvInterac-
       tor::updateHlite.

       else if picker state includes PFPICKER_FOCUS_EVENT, picker
       will isect the scene to determine if some geometry is cur-
       rently under focus, and will look for a pointer to  pfvIn-
       teractor  in  pfNodes'  user slots.  If a pfvInteractor is
       found, event will be passed on to it  through  pfvInterac-
       tor::specialFocus.

       Note  that NULL events (inserted by picker on frames where

       <B>pfvPicker::pick()</B> causes a 3d segment into the 3d scene to
       be  computed, and an intersection test carried out between
       that segment and 3d geometry contained in  scene.  The  3d
       segment  that  will  be tested for intersection depends on
       the actual picker implementation. Both pfvMousePicker  and
       pfvInputMngrPicker  will  compute  isect  segment based on
       current mouse position. Other pickers could be implemented
       which compute their isect segment based on the position of
       a tracked input device, such as a space wand, for example.

       <B>pfvPicker::computeIsectSeg()</B>  is  the  virtual method that
       picker will call in order to compute the 3D  segment  that
       will  be  used  for  scene  intersection. Aaplication code
       should never need to call this method directly.

       <B>pfvPicker::getPickResults(pfvInteractor**</B> <B>ia)</B> will copy  a
       pointer to the pfvInteractor assigned to the geometry that
       was picked by the last  call  to  pfvPicker::pick.  If  no
       geometry  was picked, or if no pfvInteractors were associ-
       ated with picked geometry, this method returns NULL.

       <B>pfvPicker::getPickResults(pfNode**</B>  <B>node)</B>  will   copy   a
       pointer  to the pfNode that was picked by the last call to
       pfvPicker::pick. If no geometry was  picked,  this  method
       returns NULL.

       <B>pfvPicker::getPickList()</B>  returns a pointer to an array of
       pfHit  pointers,  each  pointing  to  a  pfHit  record  as
       returned  by  picker's intersection test. If multiple hits
       are returned, the first element of the returned array will
       point  to  the  pfHit  record corresponding to the nearest
       intersection point.

       Note that in current implementation of pfvPicker only  one
       pick  result  is  returned  as  the  first  element of the
       returned array.

       The following example shows how to obtain a pointer to the
       pfGeoSet picked by picker's isect traversal:


           pfvPicker* picker;
           ...
           p-&gt;pick();
           pfHits**hits = p-&gt;getPickedList();
           pfGeoSet* gset;
           if(hits[0])
               hits[0]-&gt;query(PFQHIT_GSET,&amp;gset);


       <B>pfvPicker::setDefaultSelector()</B> sets the default selector
       for picker.  If a default selector has been set, picker
       will automatically make it the current selector whenever
       state would otherwise have no current selector.

       <B>pfvPicker::getDefaultSelector()</B> returns a pointer to
       picker's default selector, if one has been set through
       <B>pfvPicker::setDefaultSelector()</B>, or NULL otherwise.
       PFPICKER_INTERACT, else it will return NULL.

       <B>pfvPicker::setState()</B> requests a state change for picker.
       Parameter s indicates the desired new state. If state s
       implies that a current interactor or current selector
       should be known to picker, the sel and ia arguments will
       be used to provide pointers to the desired current selec-
       tor and interactor. Note that this method may trigger
       interactor and/or selector callbacks to be called by
       picker in order to inform them of the state change.

       <B>pfvPicker::grantRequest</B> is an alternative method for
       requesting a new state for picker. The argument is a
       pointer to a pfvPickerRequest structure which contains
       three members: an integer indicating desired new state, a
       pointer to pfvInteractor and one to pfvSelector indicating
       the desired current interactor and/or selector.

       <B>pfvPicker::collectEvents()</B> is the virtual method that
       picker will call in order to produce a list of all events
       generated since last frame.  Aaplication code should never
       need to call this method directly.

       <B>pfvPicker::getEventList()</B> can be called to obtain a
       pointer to a list of all the events collected by the last
       call to <B>pfvPicker::collectEvents()</B>.
