<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The pfvInputMngr class is used to track mouse and keyboard
       events  over  multiple pipes, pipewindows and channels, as
       configured by the Display Manager.

       pfvInputMngr makes extensive use of the pfutil library for
       input collection.

       <B>pfvInputMngr::init</B>  initializes  input  collection  on all
       pwins created by the pfvDisplayMngr. This function must be
       called   after   pfvDispMngr::postConfig,   since  pfPipe,
       pfPipeWindow and pfChannels are expected to  exist  before
       input  can  be  initialized.  <B>pfvInputMngr::init</B> will call
       pfuInitMultiChanInput.

       <B>pfvInputMngr::collectEvents</B> will  collect  all  mouse  and
       keyboard  events  generated  since method was last called,
       and will carry out useful computation such as establishing
       which  view  has  current mouse focus, and computing mouse
       coordinates in channel,pwin  and  view-normalized  coords.
       Note  that  <B>pfvInputMngr::collectEvents</B>  will call pfuGet-
       Mouse and pfuGetEvents.

       <B>pfvInputMngr::getMouse</B> returns a pointer to  the  pfuMouse
       structure  used  by  pfvInputMngr  to  collect  mouse data
       through pfuGetMouse. This  points  to  a  static  pfuMouse
       structure within the pfvInputMngr class and will therefore
       remain valid through the course of the application.

       <B>pfvInputMngr::getEvents</B>   returns   a   pointer   to   the
       pfuEventStream  structure  used by pfvInputMngr to collect
       keyboard event data  through pfuGetEvents.  This points to
       a  static pfuEventStream structure within the pfvInputMngr
       class and will therefore remain valid through  the  course
       of the application.

       <B>pfvInputMngr::getFocusViewIndex</B>  returns  the index of the
       Manager's view-list.  Note that when dragging cursor while
       keeping one or more buttons pressed, focus is retained  by
       the  view  over  which  button was first pressed, so it is
       possible to have a valid focus-view index even if mouse is
       not over a channel belonging to such view.

       <B>pfvInputMngr::getViewNormXY</B>   will  return  current  mouse
       coordinates normalized to the  current  focus-view.  View-
       normalized  coordinates  are computed based on focus-chan-
       nel's  view-range  settings  (see  man  page  for  pfvDis-
       pChan::setViewRange).

       <B>pfvInputMngr::getFocusChanIndex</B>  returns  the index of the
       pfvDispChannel that has current  mouse  focus.  The  index
       associated  with  a  channel  is  that returned by pfvDis-
       pChan::getIndex, and represents channel's position in Dis-
       play  Manager's  channel-list.  If  no channel has current
       mouse focus, this method returns -1.

       <B>pfvInputMngr::getFocusChan()</B>  returns  a  pointer  to  the
       pfvDispChan  with  current  mouse focus. If no channel has
       current mouse focus, this method returns NULL.

       <B>pfvInputMngr::getChanNormXY</B>  returns  the  current  cursor
       position normalized to focus-channel's viewport.

       <B>pfvInputMngr::getChanAbsXY</B>   returns  the  current  cursor
       position expressed as integer offsets (in pixels) from the
       bottom-left  corner  of  viewport  of channel with current
       focus.

       <B>pfvInputMngr::getFocusPWinIndex</B> returns the index  of  the
       pfvDispPWin with current mouse focus. The index associated
       with a pwin is that returned by pfvDispPWin::getIndex, and
       represents pwin's position in Display Manager's pwin-list.

       <B>pfvInputMngr::getPWinNormXY</B>  will  return  current   mouse
       coordinates normalized to the current focus-pwin.

       <B>pfvInputMngr::getPWinAbsXY</B>   returns  the  current  cursor
       position expressed as integer offsets (in pixels) from the
       bottom-left corner of pipe window with current focus.

       <B>pfvInputMngr::addCallback</B>  registers the callback function
       func with the Input Manager. data is  a  pointer  to  user
       data  that will be passed as an argument to callback when-
       ever it is called by InputMngr.  evMask is  a  zero-termi-
       nated  string  containing  a  list  of key values to which
       callback function needs to be associated.  viewMask  is  a
       64-bit mask indicating that callback should be called only
       if event (key press) happens over the collection of  views
       specified by mask.  Note that if mask is equal to 0, call-
       back will be associated with  all  views.   This  function
       creates and returns a handle to a new pfvInputMngrCallback
       object. This pointer can be stored by user so  that  call-
       back  can  later  be removed, or associated with different
       keys, or with different views.  See man  page  for  pfvIn-
       putMngrCallback.

       userData.

       <B>pfvInputMngr::findCallback</B> will look  through  all  regis-
       tered  pfvInputMngrCallbacks,  and return a pointer to the
       first one that has func as an  associated  callback  func-
       tion,  and  data  as  associated userData.  If no matching
       pfvInputMngrCallback is found, NULL is returned.

       <B>pfvInputMngr::getNumCallbacks</B> returns the number  of  cur-
       rently registered pfvInputMngrCallbacks.

       <B>pfvInputMngr::getCallback</B>  returns  a  pointer  to the ith
       pfvInputMngrCallback in global list held by Input  Manager
       if i is a valid index, else method returns NULL.

       <B>pfvInputMngr::dispatchKeyEvent</B>  can  be used to simulate a
       key-press event for any given key. The input manager  will
       go  through  the  list  of pfvInputMngrCallbacks which are
       currently enabled for that key, and will call  the  corre-
       sponding  user  callbacks  until  one of them returns non-
       zero, indicating that key-down event was used (grabbed) by
       user-callback.   If vMask is non-zero, only user-callbacks
       associated with pfvInputMngrCallbacks whose  view-mask  is
       either  zero,  or  the  result  of a bitwise OR on the two
       masks is itself non-zero are called.

       The method <B>pfvInputMngr::dispatchEvents</B> will look  at  the
       pfuEventStream  structure  allocated by the Input Manager,
       and will dispatch callback calls for all events it  finds.
       Note  that  for  each  event in pfuEventStream struct, the
       method <B>pfvInputMngr::dispatchKeyEvent</B>  is  called  with  a
       viewMask  corresponding to the view with current focus, or
       zero if no view has current focus.

       <B>pfvInputMngr::getKeyName</B> returns a pointer to the name  (a
       string),  associated with the key-value key. For a list of
       all   defined   key   values   see   the    header    file
       /usr/include/Performer/pfv/pfvInput.h.      The    strings
       returned by <B>pfvInputMngr::getKeyName</B>  can  be  deduced  by
       removing the PFVKEY_ prefix from the #defined token names.
       Eg: key= PFVKEY_a, key-name=  "a"  key=  PFVKEY_BACKSLASH,
       key-name= "BACKSLASH"

       <B>pfvInputMngr::getKeyFromName</B>  returns the key value corre-
       sponding to the key whose name matches string keyName,  or
       0 if no key name matches.
