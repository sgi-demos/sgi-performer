<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The pfvInteractor class is a base class for setting up and
       managing user-interaction with a scene or a portion  of  a
       scene. Instances of pfvInteractor objects are not expected
       to be created by applications; instead applications should
       derive their own classes from pfvInteractor, and implement
       specific interaction through the implementation of  pfvin-
       teractor's virtual methods.

       pfvInteractors work in conjunction with pfvPicker objects.
       A single ppfvPicker may coordinate the action of  multiple
       interactors.   Basically, the picker will isect a scene to
       determine which pfNode is currently under focus;  It  will
       then try to find the pfvInteractor that has been set up to
       manage interaction for picked node.  Assignment of a  pfv-
       interactor  to  a  pfNode is done through the use of Named
       Data  Slots  (see  man  page  for  pfObject::getNamedUser-
       DataSlot).  Each  picker  will  be configured to look at a
       certain slot index. The picked node user-slot is  examined
       first: if slot contains a pointer to an active pfvInterac-
       tor, the search ends. If user-slot is  NULL,  then  picker
       continues  its  search   for  an  interactor by looking at
       node's parent data-slot, and walks up the pfNode hierarchy
       until  a  pointer to an active interactor  is found or the
       pfScene root-node is found.  Note that pfvinteractors  can
       also be assigned to pfScene nodes.

       A pfvInteractor supports the following functionalities:

       HLITE: If picker state includes PFPICKER_ALLOW_HLITE, when
       picker focus is on some geometry  managed  by  interactor,
       interactor  can  accept  hlite  state. A pfvInteractor may
       decide to render hlited geometry in a different style (eg:
       wireframe),  or to change cursor shape, in order to signal
       to the user that interaction  with  hlited  geometry  will
       take  place  if  user  generates  the right events (actual
       event types depend on picker implementation).

       FOCUS_EVENTS:     When     picker      state      includes
       PFPICKER_FOCUS_EVENT,  interactor will receive events from
       picker if these are generated while  focus  is  over  some
       geometry  managed  by  interactor.   Interactor can ignore
       each event, or respond to it by carrying  out  a  one-time
       action,  or  by  accepting  INTERACT  state,  which allows
       interactions to be carried out over a  number  of  frames,
       such  as  for  example  dragging  a slider, or rotating an
       object.

       INTERACTION: Once interactor has requested INTERACT state,
       picker  will  guarantee  at  least one call to pfvInterac-
       tor::updateInteraction  on  each  frame  (the  number   of
       updates  is  greater if more than one event were collected
       by picker during current frame).

       <B>pfvInteractor::getActive</B> will be called by picker (with  a
       pointer  to  itself  passed on as an argument) in order to
       node.

       <B>pfvInteractor::startHlite</B>  will  be  called  by  picker to
       offer interactor a chance to accept hlite state. This will
       only     happen     if     picker's     state     includes
       PFPICKER_ALLOW_HLITE, and if focus is currently over geom-
       etry  assigned  to  this interactor through node data slot
       assignment. Interactor may return 0 to reject hlite state,
       or  non-zero  to  accept it.  The value of parameter prmsn
       will contain the permission mask granted by picker's  cur-
       rent  selector.  prmsn is a bitwise integer containing any
       of the following tokens:

           o PFPICKER_HLITE, indicating that interactor has permissions
             to accept hlite state.
           o PFPICKER_INTERACT, indicating that interactor has permission
             to request and enter
             interact state.
           o PFPICKER_SELECT, indicating that interactor has permission to
             request select state.

       Note however that pfvInteractors cannot accept select
       state. See man page for pfvSelector for details of how to
       carry out object selection through the pfvPicker API.
       Note also that if picker has no current selector, permis-
       sions will be equal to PFPICKER_FULL_PERMISSIONS.

       <B>pfvInteractor::updateHlite</B> will be called by picker on
       every frame while interactor maintains hlited state. If
       events have been collected by picker while interactor is
       in hlited state, events will be passed as argument ev in
       <B>pfvInteractor::updateHlite</B>.  Parameter prmsn indicates the
       level of permissions granted by picker's current selector.

       <B>pfvInteractor::endHlite</B> will be called by the picker to
       indicate that focus is no longer over geometry assigned to
       interactor, and thus interactor must leave hlite state.
       Interactor is expected to restore normal appearance of
       hlited geometry, or restore cursor shape accordingly.

       <B>pfvInteractor::specialFocus</B> will be called by picker when
       picker's state includes PFPICKER_FOCUS_EVENT, and an event
       has been generated while focus is over geometry assigned
       to this interactor. Parameter ev will indicate which event
       was generated, prmsn will indicate the permission level
       granted by picker's current selector, and r will point to
       a pfvPickerRequest structure initialized to picker's cur-
       rent state, which can be modified by interactor in order
       to request a state change.

       <B>pfvInteractor::startInteraction</B> will be called by picker
       in order to offer interactor a chance to accept INTERACT
       state. Usually this will happen in response to a request
       made by interactor itself through methods updateHlite or
       specialFocus. Alternatively, this can happen if method
       pfvPicker::setState or pfvPicker::grantRequest were called
       with request state including PFPICKER_HLITE or
       PFPICKER_INTERACT, and a pointer to this as requested
       interactor.
       current selector.

       <B>pfvInteractor::endInteraction</B> will be called by the picker
       to indicate that interactor must leave INTERACT state.

       <B>pfvInteractor::getState</B> returns interactor's current
       state. This may include PFPICKER_HLITE or PFPICKER_INTER-
       ACT indicating that interactor is currently in hlite or in
       interact state respectively.

       <B>pfvInteractor::isHlited</B> returns 1 if interactor is cur-
       rently in HLITED state, 0 otherwise.

       <B>pfvInteractor::isInteracting</B> returns 1 if interactor is
       currently in INTERACT state, 0 otherwise

       <B>pfvInteractor::nodeSetup(pfNode*</B> <B>node,</B> <B>int</B> <B>slotIndex)</B> sets
       the data slot with index slotIndex of node to point to
       this interactor.

       <B>pfvInteractor::nodeSetup(pfNode*</B> <B>node,</B> <B>pfvPicker*</B> <B>p)</B> first
       queries picker to find out which data slot is of interest
       to it, then sets the appropriate data slot of node to
       point to this interactor.

       <B>pfvInteractor::nodeSetup(pfNode*</B> <B>node,</B> <B>char*slotName)</B> sets
       the named slot of node to point to this interactor.

       <B>pfvInteractor::nodeSetup(pfNode*node)</B> sets the slot named
       "PFPICKER" of node to point to this interactor.

       <B>pfvInteractor::clearNodeSlot(pfNode*</B> <B>node,</B> <B>int</B> <B>slotIndex)</B>
       sets the slot with index slotIndex of node to NULL.

       <B>pfvInteractor::clearNodeSlot(pfNode*</B> <B>node,</B> <B>pfvPicker*</B> <B>p)</B>
       first queries picker to find out which data slot is of
       interest to it, then sets the appropriate data slot of
       node to NULL.

       <B>pfvInteractor::clearNodeSlot(pfNode*</B> <B>node,</B> <B>char*slotName)</B>
       sets the named slot of node to NULL.

       <B>pfvInteractor::clearNodeSlot(pfNode*node)</B> sets the slot
       named "PFPICKER" of node to NULL.
