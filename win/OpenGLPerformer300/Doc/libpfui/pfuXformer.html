<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       In  releases of OpenGL Performer since 2.0, the pfuXformer
       has been moved to libpfui --  the  OpenGL  Performer  User
       Interface  library, and is now the pfiXformer.  The origi-
       nal pfuXformer API has been preserved, but now has a  pfi-
       prefix.   For  compatibility  with  previous  releases  of
       OpenGL Performer, there are compatibility defines from the
       old  <I>pfu</I>  routine  names  to  the new <I>pfi</I> routine names in
       &lt;Performer/pfui.h&gt; that are enabled if  the  PF_COMPAT_1_2
       variable is defined.

       See  the  <B>pfiNewXformer</B>  man  page  for information on the
       pfiXformer.

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       These functions are provided to  ease  the  transition  of
       programs  from the older IRIS Performer 1.2 release to the
       current release. These functions should not be used in new
       application  development  since  they will be removed in a
       future release of OpenGL Performer.
