<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The pfuProcessManager class hierarchy implements an exten-
       sible  process  manager  framework bsed on the pfuBasePro-
       the current process manager.

       <B>pfuProcessManagerMode</B>  will set the specified <I>mode</I> for the
       currently active process manager to the given value,  <I>val</I>.
       The modes and associated values are to be supported by all
       process managers are:

              <B>PFUPM_CONTINUOUS</B>         takes a boolean  value  to
                                       indicate continuous opera-
                                       tion and placement of  new
                                       processes,  or if explicit
                                       calls to  reconfigure  the
                                       process manager need to be
                                       made  to  trigger  process
                                       control.

              <B>PFUPM_LOCK_DOWN</B>          takes  a  boolean value to
                                       indicate  if  locking   of
                                       processes   to  processors
                                       and potential isolation of
                                       those   processors  should
                                       occur.  The default  value
                                       is <B>FALSE</B>.

              <B>PFUPM_PRIORITIES</B>         takes  a  boolean value to
                                       indicate   if    processes
                                       should   be   given   non-
                                       degrading priorties.   The
                                       default value is <B>FALSE</B>.
       <B>pfuGetProcessManagerMode</B>  will return the current value of
       <I>mode</I> for the currently active process manager.

       <B>pfuReconfigureProcessManager</B> will force the  current  pro-
       cess  manager  to  do a replacement of all registered pro-
       cesses according to the current mode settings.

       <B>pfuReleaseProcessManager</B> will force the  release  of  iso-
       lated  CPUs and processes registered with the current pro-
       cess manager.  Processes will have non-degrading priorties
       removed and will be allowed to run on any CPU.

       <B>pfuInitDefaultProcessManager</B> will create and select a pro-
       cess manager with a default  policy.   The  pfuDefaultPro-
       cessManger  uses the <B>pfCreateProcessFunc</B> API to register a
       callback function with libpf that will be called upone the
       creation     of     any    OpenGL    Performer    process.
       <B>pfuGetProcessMiscCPU</B> is used to determine which CPU is  to
       be  considered  the non-real-time miscellaneous CPU (typi-
       cally CPU 0).  The pfuDefaultProcessManger will place Per-
       former  processes  onto  processors  and set non-degrading
       priorities on critical processes as described below.   The
       routines  implementing  these  features  utilize  the IRIX
       REACT facilities.   Refer  to  the  IRIX  REACT  technical
       report,  and  the  <B>sysmp(2)</B>  and <B>realtime(5)</B> man pages for
       detailed information on these concepts.

       The policy implemented by the <B>pfuDefaultProcessManager</B> is:
       1.  First, if there are sufficient CPUs, each of <B>APP,</B> <B>CULL</B>
       and <B>DRAW</B> gets its own processor and no critical path  pro-
       CPUs if there are enough available CPUs.  Otherwise,  they
       will  be  given  the last CPU.  3. Next, <B>ISECT</B> and <B>COMPUTE</B>
       processes are given their CPUs or paired if there  is  one
       additional  CPU  or  else given the MISC CPU.  4. Finally,
       the <B>DBASE</B> and <B>QUEUE</B> process(es) are given their  own  CPUs
       or paired if there is one additional CPU or else given the
       MISC CPU.

       Multipipe mappings are as follows.

       If NumCPUs &gt;= 2 + 2*NumPipes
       then each cull and draw process can have its own CPU and are placed together
       on a CPU node. The application is placed on CPU 1 with UNIX getting CPU 0.

       If NumCPUs == 1 + 2*NumPipes
       then the application shares CPU 0 with UNIX.

       Otherwise, if NumCPUs &gt;= 2 + NumPipes
       then cull and draw processes for each pipe are paired together.

       The LPoint processes are also  given their own CPUs if there are enough
       available CPUs.  Otherwise, they are grouped together on a single CPU,
       their own if there is on extra, else the last CPU.


       The pfuProcessManager provides 2 mechanisms of extensibil-
       ity: C++ subclassing and C callbacks. The pfuBaseProcess-
       Manager and pfuDefaultProcessManager can both be sub-
       classed and new instances can be made the current process
       manager.  In addition, custom user callbacks can be
       assigned to hand specific types of processes defined by
       the <B>PFU_PROC_*</B> mask or unknown processes.

       <B>pfuProcessManagerCreateFunc</B> sets a custom user callback
       for handling the creation of new processes.  The return
       value should be <B>PFU_CB_CONT</B> if the user has decided to let
       the pfuProcessManager handle the function and <B>PFU_CB_TERM</B>
       if the user has processed it.  The current user function
       and associated mask is gotten with
       <B>pfuGetProcessManagerCreateFunc</B>.

       <B>pfuProcessManagerPlaceFunc</B> sets a custom user callback for
       handling the processor placement of new processes.  The
       placement function should return the chosen CPU number or
       (-1) if the user has choosen to not handle the process.
       The cpu placement will be done upon the explicit or auto-
       matic call by the process manager to place processes.
       <B>pfuGetProcessManagerPlaceFunc</B> will return the current user
       placement function and process mask.

       <B>pfuProcessManagerPrioritizeFunc</B> sets a custom user call-
       back for handling the processor prioritization of new pro-
       cesses.  The function should return the chosen priority
       relative to the app process or <B>PFUMP_NOPRI</B> if the user has
       choosen to not handle the process.  The process priority
       will be set upon the explicit or automatic call by the
       process manager to place processes.
       <B>pfuGetProcessManagerPrioritizeFunc</B> will return the current
       user prioritization function and process mask.
           pfuInitDefaultProcessManager;
           .....
           //
           // Configure OpenGL Performer and fork extra processes if
           // configured for multiprocessing.
           //
           pfConfig();

           // Tell ProcessManager to configure the system
           pfuProcessManagerMode(PFUPM_CONTINUOUS, 1);
           pfuProcessManagerMode(PFUPM_LOCK_DOWN, 1);
           pfuProcessManagerMode(PFUPM_PRIORITIES, 1);
           pfuReconfigureProcessManager;

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       CPU isolation or restriction functionality is not cur-
       rently supported under Linux.

       Isolating a CPU to run specific processes requires super-
       user permission.  Setting non-degrading priorities on pro-
       cesses requires super-user permission.

       CPU 0 should <I>never</I> be isolated.

       A utility shell script is provided in /usr/share/Per-
       former/src/tools/freeproc that can be run as super-user to
       clean up after a program that exits ungracefully.

       The libpfutil source code, object code and documentation
       are provided as unsupported software.  Routines are sub-
       ject to change in future releases.
