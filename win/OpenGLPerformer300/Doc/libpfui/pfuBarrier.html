       spin-free multiprocess barrier routines

<H2>FUNCTION SPECIFICATION</H2><PRE>
       #include &lt;Performer/pfutil.h&gt;

       pfuBarrier *   <B>pfuBarrierCreate</B>(usptr_t *usptr);

       void           <B>pfuBarrierDestroy</B>(pfuBarrier *b);

       void           <B>pfuBarrierEnter</B>(pfuBarrier *b,
                        unsigned int n);

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       These  functions  provide  a rendezvous mechanism for syn-
       chronizing processes.  The API and functionality is analo-
       gous to IRIX libc's barrier(), but the implementation uses
       semaphores instead of spinning, and is therefore  hundreds
       of  times  faster  than barrier() when there is contention
       for processors.

       <B>pfuBarrierCreate()</B> takes a usptr_t as an argument to indi-
       cate  the shared arena from which to allocate the barrier.
       This should be either Performer's semaphore arena obtained
       by pfGetSemaArena(), or an arena handle obtained through a
       call to usinit().  If the barrier cannot be  created  then
       NULL  is  returned and the system errno is set to indicate
       the error.

       <B>pfuBarrierDestroy()</B> releases all storage  associated  with
       <B>b</B>.

       <B>pfuBarrierEnter()</B>  takes  a  pointer to a previously allo-
       cated    barrier     structure     (as     returned     by
       <B>pfuBarrierCreate()</B>)  and  the number of participating pro-
       cesses.  As each process  enters  the  barrier,  it  waits
       (using a semaphore) until all <B>n</B> processes have entered, at
       which time all are released and continue  executing.   The
       barrier may be reused immediately.



</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       The  implementation  does  not depend on any other part of
       Performer.  It uses  two  semaphores  allocated  from  the
       semaphore arena.

       There  is  no analogue of libc's init_barrier() to reset a
       barrier, since it's nonsense.

       The libpfutil source code, object code  and  documentation
       are  provided  as unsupported software.  Routines are sub-
       ject to change in future releases.
