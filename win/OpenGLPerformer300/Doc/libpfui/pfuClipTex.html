<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       pfMPClipTextures  must be attached to pipes if they are to
       update properly.  In order to connect the  same  pfMPClip-
       Texture to more than one pipe, the pfMPClipTexture must be
       cloned; the original pfMPClipTexture becomes  the  master,
       and the new pfMPClipTexture becomes the slave.

       This  is done automatically if the same pfMPClipTexture is
       added to more than one pipe. This routine makes  the  pro-
       cess  more  convenient,  by  allowing  the user to specify
       which pipe should contain the master cliptexture, what set
       of  pipes  should  have the pfMPClipTextures attached, and
       the pfMPClipTexture(s) that should be attached.

       This routine does additional checking to  avoid  erroneous
       operations.  For  example,  it checks to avoid common mis-
       takes such as; trying to attach the  same  pfMPClipTexture
       to the same pfPipe more than once, not adding a slave to a
       pfPipe that already contains the slave's master, etc. This
       makes  it possible to run the routine multiple times with-
       out generating warnings.

       <B>pfuAddMPClipTextureToPipes</B> takes a pointer to an pfMPClip-
       Texture <I>master</I> which is put in <I>masterpipe</I>. All other pipes
       in <I>pipes</I> are given slaves to this cliptexture.
       If only a single pfMPClipTexture needs to be attached, use
       the  <B>pfuAddMPClipTextureToPipes</B>  routine.  If  a number of
       pfMPClipTextures need to be attached to pfPipes,  you  can
       call <B>pfuAddMPClipTextureToPipes</B> multiple times or create a
       list of them and pass  it  to  <B>pfuAddMPClipTexturesToPipes</B>
       using  <I>mpcliptextures</I>.  This  is particulary convenient if
       you   are    using    the    clipcenter    nodes,    since
       <B>pfuProcessClipCenters</B> fills in the pfList you give it with
       the list of pfMPClipTexture objects in the scene graph.

       <B>pfuInitClipTexConfig</B>,       <B>pfuMakeClipTexture</B>,        and
       <B>pfuFreeClipTexConfig</B>  are used together to create and con-
       figure  clip  textures.  These  routines   are   used   by
       <B>pfdLoadClipTexture</B>,  and  can  be  used by applications to
       build cliptextures dynamically or to  design  custom  clip
       texture  configuration  file  formats.  pfuMakeClipTexture
       takes a single argument, a pointer to a properly filled in
       pfuClipTexConfig structure, and uses the information in it
       to create and configure a cliptexture, its  image  caches,
       and  its  pyramid  image  tiles.  The pfuInitClipTexConfig
       called before pfuMakeClipTexture; it's purpose is to  fill
       in  the  pfuClipTexConfig  structure  with default values.
       pfuFreeClipTexConfig is called last, after the cliptexture
       has  been  created. It correctly frees any elements of the
       structure that have been created (although it doesn't free
       the structure itself).

       The recommended proceedure is to allocate a pfuClipTexCon-
       fig structure, call pfuInitClipTexConfig to initialize it,
       fill  in  the values of the structure to describe the clip
       texture  desired,  then  call  pfuMakeClipTexture  with  a
       pointer  to  the  initialized  and  filled  in  structure.
       Finally, call pfuFreeClipTexConfig to free  any  structure
       elements,   then  delete  the  pfuClipTexConfig  structure
       itself. The advantage of this proceedure is that structure
       elements  are  filled  in  with reasonable default values,
       allowing optional values to be left out. It also  improves
       error  checking,  since the error checking code knows what
       the default values should be,  allowing  it  to  warn  the
       application if mandatory values weren't filled in.

       The  pfuClipTexConfig structure has three types of values:
       configuration data for the  cliptexture  itself,  function
       pointers  to  user-supplied  functions that load the image
       caches and image tiles that the clip texture requires, and
       pointers to user-defined data structures used by the user-
       supplied configuration functions.

       The  user-supplied  image  cache  configuration   function
       should  be  an  argument of the following format: pfImage-
       Cache *func(pfClipTexture *ct, int level, pfuClipTexConfig
       *config)

       This    function    should    use   <B>pfuInitImgCacheConfig</B>,
       <B>pfuMakeImageCache</B>, and <B>pfuFreeImgCacheConfig</B> in  the  same
       way as was done for configuring cliptextures, and return a
       pointer to the created and configured  image  cache.  This
       function  can  access the user-supplied data in the icData
       element of the _pfuClipTexConfig structure for  additional
       This function should create  and  configure  the  required
       image  tile  and return a pointer to it. This function can
       access the user-supplied data in the tileData  element  of
       the  _pfuClipTexConfig  structure  for additional informa-
       tion.

       The configuration functions allow the application to  cus-
       tomize  how  image  caches  and image tiles are configured
       when an clip texture is created.  The pfdLoadImage.c  file
       uses  this functionality and should be used as an example.

       The    <B>pfuInitImgCacheConfig</B>,    <B>pfuMakeImageCache</B>,    and
       <B>pfuFreeImgCacheConfig</B>  functions  are used in the same way
       as described for <B>pfuInitClipTexConfig</B>, <B>pfuMakeClipTexture</B>,
       and  <B>pfuFreeClipTexConfig</B>.   The  major difference is that
       the pfuImgCacheConfig structure doesn't require  user-sup-
       plied function or data pointers.

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       ClipTexture functionality is not supported under Linux.

       The  libpfutil  source code, object code and documentation
       are provided as unsupported software.  Routines  are  sub-
       ject to change in future releases.
