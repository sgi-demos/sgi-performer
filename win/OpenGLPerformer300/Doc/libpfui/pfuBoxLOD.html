       <B>pfuBoxLOD,</B>  <B>pfuMakeBoxGSet</B> - Calculate node bounding boxes
       and build LODs from boxes.

<H2>FUNCTION SPECIFICATION</H2><PRE>
       #include &lt;Performer/pfutil.h&gt;

       pfLOD *      <B>pfuBoxLOD</B>(pfGroup *grp,             int flat,
                      pfVec4 *color);

       pfGeoSet *   <B>pfuMakeBoxGSet</B>(pfBox *box,      pfVec4 color,
                      int flat);

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       These functions can be used to automatically generate very
       simple  level-of-detail representations of a subgraph from
       the bounding boxes of the geometric objects  contained  in
       that subgraph.  Sending a node to <B>pfuBoxLOD</B> creates multi-
       ple representations for  that  node  by  finding  bounding
       boxes  at  different  levels  of  the scene graph and then
       using those boxes as level-of-detail  models  under  <B>pfLOD</B>
       nodes.   The  highest  level-of-detail  under the <B>pfLOD</B> is
       simply the original subgraph.  The next highest  level-of-
       detail  consists  of  the  subgraph  with  each  <B>pfGeode's</B>
       <B>pfGeoSets</B> replaced by a single <B>pfGeoSet</B> depicting  a  box.
       Next  every <B>pfGeode</B> is replaced by a single "box" <B>pfGeode</B>.
       This continues to progressively lower levels-of-detail  as
       the  "box"  <B>pfGeodes</B>  contain larger and larger subgraphs,
       until the box rendered for the lowest level-of-detail con-
       tains  the entire subgraph.  The new partial subgraphs are
       created using <B>pfClone</B>.  The  LOD  transition  ranges  (see
       <B>pfLODRange</B>)  are  set  as integer multiples of the spatial
       extent of the subgraph.

       <B>pfuBoxLOD</B> takes a subgraph <I>grp</I>, a color vector <I>color</I>,  and
       a  shading  type  <I>flat</I>.   <I>grp</I> specifies the existing scene
       graph hierarchy to be processed.  The <I>color</I> argument  pro-
       vides the color definition used for the boxes that will be
       built.  The shading type <I>flat</I> determines  each  <B>pfGeoSet</B>'s
       primitive type and normals.  If <I>flat</I> is non-zero, the gen-
       erated <B>pfGeoSet</B>'s are made up of <B>PFGS_FLAT_TRISTRIP</B> primi-
       tives  with  face directed normals.  If <I>flat</I> is zero, they
       consist of <B>PFGS_TRISTRIP</B> primitives with normals  directed
       radially  outwards.   The  former produces sharply defined
       cubes, the latter marshmallows.

       To determine the appropriate size  of  the  box  geometry,
       <B>pfuBoxLOD</B>  uses  <B>pfuTravCalcBBox</B> to get a tighter bound on
       the subgraphs than <B>pfGetNodeBSphere</B> provides.

       <B>pfuMakeBoxGSet</B> takes a <B>pfBox</B> <I>box</I> and  returns  a  <B>pfGeoSet</B>
       containing  drawable geometry that represents the box with
       color <I>color</I> and a shading  type  determined  by  <I>flat</I>,  as
       explained  in  the  description  of  <B>pfuBoxLOD</B> above.  The
       <B>pfGeoSet</B> and associated arrays are allocated from the cur-

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       The LOD transition range setting is very primitive.
