<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>pfiTDFXformer</B> is a facility developed using the pfiXformer
       to provide a convenient utility for managing motion models
       derived from  pfiInputXformTrackball,  pfiInputXformDrive,
       and  pfiInputXformFly  and providing a default user inter-
       face for  such  motion  models  based  on  input  received
       through  a  pfuMouse  structure.   This utility is used by
       OpenGL Performer sample programs, such as perfly, in  con-
       junction  with  the  libpfutil  input collection utilities
       (see the <B>pfuInitInput</B> reference  page  for  more  informa-
       tion).

       A  pfiTDFXformer is a child of the pfiXformer class and so
       pfiXformer routines may be called  with  a  pfiTDFXformer.
       See  the  pfiXformer and pfiInputXform reference pages for
       information on other general functionality.  Functionality
       specific to the pfiXformer are discussed here The pfiTDFX-
       former has a complete C++ API following the conventions of
       general OpenGL Performer C++ API; C++ methods are declared
       in /usr/include/Performer/pfui/pfiXformer.h.  This  refer-
       ence page only discusses the C API.

       <B>pfiInit</B>  should  be  called  once before any pfiTDFXformer
       routines and before the forked creation of any  additional
       processes that will be calling pfiXformer routines.

       <B>pfiGetTDFXformerClassType</B>   returns  the  <B>pfType</B>*  for the
       class <B>pfiXformer</B>.  Because OpenGL  Performer  allows  sub-
       classing  of built-in types, when decisions are made based
       on the type of an object, it  is  usually  better  to  use
       <B>pfIsOfType</B>  to test if an object is of a type derived from
       a Performer type rather than to test for  strict  equality
       of the <B>pfType</B>*'s.

       <B>pfiNewTDFXformer</B>  creates  a new <B>pfiTDFXformer</B> data struc-
       ture as described above and  returns  a  pointer  to  that
       structure.   <I>arena</I>  should specify the shared arena handle
       returned by <B>pfGetSharedArena</B> or from the  process  dynamic
       memory area.

       <B>pfiProcessTDFXformerMouse</B>  is  the default update function
       used by the pfiTDFXformer and implements a interface based
       on  input  from  pfuMouse  and  pfChannel  specified  with
       <B>pfiXformerAutoInput</B>. The type of  the  currently  selected
       motion  model  (selected with <B>pfiSelectXformerModel</B>) is to

       <B>TRACKBALL</B>
            Motion  models  derived  from  <B>pfiInputXformTrackball</B>
            will get the  <B>TRACKBALL</B>  mouse  mapping.   This  mode
            causes the transformation matrix to be transformed as
            if the user was using the mouse  pointer  to  spin  a
            virtual trackball that surrounds the scene.  The cen-
            ter of the  scene  is  the  computed  center  of  the
            database supplied by <B>pfiXformerNode</B>, or the center of
            the    supplied    database    bounding    box    via
            <B>pfiXformerLimits</B>  or <B>pfiIXformDBLimits</B> in world-space
            coordinates.  Trackball motion is intended to applied
            to  the matrix of a pfDCS transforming the database..
            This can be done automatically if the pfDCS was  sup-
            plied   with  <B>pfiXformerAutoPosition</B>.  The  trackball
            transformation  matrix  can  be  requested  from  the
            pfiTDFXformer  with <B>pfiGetXformerModelMat</B>.  Collision
            detection is disabled in trackball mode.   Two  kinds
            of motion are possible in this mode.

            <B>ROTATION</B>
                 The  user  can  "spin"  the virtual trackball by
                 holding down the middle mouse button and  moving
                 the  cursor relative to where it was at the time
                 the middle button was pressed.  Thus,  when  the
                 middle  mouse  button is down, moving the cursor
                 horizontally on the screen will  cause  rotation
                 around  Performer's  world-space  Z-axis,  while
                 moving the cursor vertically will cause rotation
                 around  Performer's world-space X-axis.  Releas-
                 ing the middle mouse  button  while  moving  the
                 cursor  will cause the <B>pfiXformer</B> to continue to
                 rotate the transformation matrix at the  current
                 rate.  Holding  down  both  the middle and right
                 mouse buttons will cause  rotation  around  Per-
                 former's world-space Y-axis.

            <B>TRANSLATION</B>
                 The  user  can  "move"  or translate the virtual
                 trackball in the XZ plane in Performer's  world-
                 space  (the  plane  of  the screen when the view
                 into the <B>pfChannel</B> is directed down the Y-axis -
                 the  default in <B>perfly</B>) by holding down the left
                 mouse button and moving the cursor  relative  to
                 its  position  at the time the left mouse button
                 was pressed.  The user can "zoom"  or  translate
                 the  virtual  trackball  on  the  Y axis in Per-
                 former's world-space by holding down  the  right
                 (or  both  left  and  right) mouse buttons while
                 moving the cursor vertically on the screen.

       ignored.  If the motion model is changed from  the  track-
       ball model to a moving viewpoint model, pfiInputXformDrive
       or pfiInputXformFly, the corresponding  final  transforma-
            transformation matrix to be  transformed  as  if  the
            user  were  using the mouse to control a car or other
            land-based vehicle.  In this mode the cursor's  posi-
            tion  relative  to the center of the screen will con-
            tinue to cause relative turning of the transformation
            matrix.   Moving  the  cursor  to  the right causes a
            right turn.  Moving the cursor to the left  causes  a
            left  turn.   Keeping  the cursor in the middle keeps
            the transformation "facing" the same direction.   The
            left and right mouse buttons control acceleration and
            deceleration, respectively. If  moving  forward,  the
            right  mouse  button will decelerate until eventually
            you start moving backward.  The left and  right  but-
            tons together will set your current speed to zero but
            allow you to control viewing direction.  So,  if  you
            are  moving  forwards  and  you desire to be going in
            reverse immediately, hit the  right  and  left  mouse
            buttons together, then release the left mouse button.
            The middle mouse button  allows  control  of  viewing
            direction while maintaining a constant speed, or will
            maintain the  current  position  if  the  viewer  was
            stopped  when  the  middle  mouse  button was pushed.
            Additionally,  when  the  middle  mouse   button   is
            pressed, the driving height may be altered by holding
            down a ctrl-key and moving the mouse up and down.   A
            single fast middle-mouse click anywhere on the screen
            will cause motion  to  stop.   Additionally,  if  all
            three mouse buttons are down, motion will stop.  When
            no mouse buttons are  down,  the  mouse  position  is
            ignored;  motion  in progress when mouse buttons were
            pressed will continue at a constant speed.

            The mouse buttons are the same as are interpreted  as
            follows:

            center  tab($)  ;  C | C L | L .  Mouse Action$Motion
            Effect _ Left mouse  down$Accelerate  forward  motion
            and  steer  Right mouse down$Decelerate motion direc-
            tion and steer  Middle  mouse  down$Maintain  current
            motion and and steer Left and Right down$Halt current
            motion and steer Fast middle click$Halt all motion No
            mouse down$mouse position is ignored.


       <B>FLY</B>  Motion  models derived from <B>pfiInputXformFly</B> will get
            the <B>FLY</B> mouse mapping.  This mode causes  the  trans-
            formation  matrix  to  be  transformed as if the user
            were using the mouse to direct flight  in  3D  space.
            The  viewer  position will follow the mouse: vertical
            motion of the mouse will direct motion up  and  down.
            The  behavior  in this mode is different from that of
            classic flight  models  where  moving  the  mouse  up
            pushes  the  nose  of  the aircraft up and moving the
            mouse down pushes the nose down. Here  the  pitch  of
            the  aircraft follows the mouse.  Motion controls are
            analogous to the pfiInputXformDrive model.  The  left
            and  right  buttons do acceleration and deceleration,
            middle mouse directs heading  and  maintains  current
            motion  at  a  constant speed.  Keeping the cursor in
            motion and and steer Left and Right down$Halt current
            motion and steer Fast middle click$Halt all motion No
            mouse down$mouse position is ignored.

       <B>pfiTDFXformerFastClickTime</B> will set the maximum time for a
       mouse button to be down and still to qualify  as  a  "fast
       click"  for  <I>xf</I> to be <I>msecs</I>. If <I>msecs</I> is less than 0, fast
       click checking will be disabled and no such clicks will be
       recognized.   The  default  fast  click  time is 300msecs.
       <B>pfiGetTDFXformerFastClickTime</B> returns the fast click  time
       for <I>xf</I>.
