       requests.  Further, the Texture Manager  allows  "trickle"
       loads, that is, partial loads of a list allowing the load-
       ing of a texture list to be amortized over several frames.


       <B>pfuTextureManager::getTextureMemoryAvailable</B>(void) returns
       the size of unused texture memory in bytes.

       <B>pfuTextureManager::getTextureMemoryUsed</B>(void) return  size
       in  bytes  of the texture memory used by the textures that
       the TextureManager if managing.

       <B>pfuTextureManager::getTextureMemoryUsedPercent</B>(void)
       returns  a percentage (0.0 to 100.0 of texture memory used
       by textures that the Texture Manager is managing.

       <B>pfuTextureManager::*addTextureList</B>(pfList *texList,  const
       char  *name, pfTexture *default) adds a texture list to be
       managed from a pfList of pfTextures <B>texList</B>.  <B>name</B>  is  an
       arbitary  name  that  is  used for identifying the texture
       list in a <B>Print</B>.  <B>default</B> is a pfTexture whose image  will
       be  substituded  in  the  case of an <B>unload</B>.  This way, no
       textures will be accidentally loaded if something is drawn
       which  references  the  texture.  <B>addTextureList</B> returns a
       pfTextureManager::pfuTexList type which is solely used  to
       pass   to  <B>deleteTextureList</B>,  <B>load</B>,  <B>unload</B>,  <B>loadUnload</B>,
       <B>willFit</B>, and <B>isListLoaded</B>.

       <B>pfuTextureManager::*addTextureList</B>(pfNode   *node,   const
       char  *name, pfTexture *default) adds a texture list to be
       managed based on a pfNode <B>node</B>.  <B>name</B> is an arbitary  name
       that  is used for identifying the texture list in a <B>Print</B>.
       <B>default</B> is a pfTexture whose image will be substituded  in
       the  case  of  an  <B>unload</B>.   This way, no textures will be
       accidentally loaded if something is drawn which references
       the   texture.   <B>addTextureList</B>  returns  a  pfTextureMan-
       ager::pfuTexList type which is  solely  used  to  pass  to
       <B>deleteTextureList</B>,  <B>load</B>, <B>unload</B>, <B>loadUnload</B>, <B>willFit</B>, and
       <B>isListLoaded</B>.


       <B>pfuTextureManager::*addTextureList</B>(pfList *texList,  const
       char  *name)  adds a texture list to be managed based on a
       pfList <B>texList</B> of pfTextures.  <B>name</B> is  an  arbitary  name
       that  is used for identifying the texture list in a <B>Print</B>.
       This version does not supply a default texture and  it  is
       therefore  possible to accidentally load a texture outside
       of the Texture Manager's control if the object  is  drawn.
       <B>addTextureList</B> returns a pfTextureManager::pfuTexList type
       which is solely used to pass to  <B>deleteTextureList</B>,  <B>load</B>,
       <B>unload</B>, <B>loadUnload</B>, <B>willFit</B>, and <B>isListLoaded</B>.


       <B>pfuTextureManager::*addTextureList</B>(pfNode   *node,   const
       char *name) adds a texture list based on  a  pfNode  <B>node</B>.
       <B>name</B>  is an arbitary name that is used for identifying the
       texture list in a <B>Print</B>.  This version does not  supply  a
       default  texture  and it is therefore possible to acciden-
       tally load a texture outside of the Texture Manager's con-
       Texture Manager is managing.

       <B>pfuTextureManager::load</B>(pfuTexList  *texList)  loads   the
       list  referred to by <B>texList</B> to texture memory.  This must
       be called from the DRAW process.

       <B>pfuTextureManager::load</B>(pfuTexList *texList,  float  dead-
       line)  loads  as  much  of the texture list referred to by
       <B>texList</B> to texture memory as it can before  <B>deadline</B>,  and
       returns a value between 0.0f and 1.0f indicating the level
       of completion.  This function can be called multiple times
       until  it  returns  1.0f.   This is useful when there is a
       need to load a large list of textures.  The  load  may  be
       amortized  over several frames.  This function can only be
       called in the DRAW process.

       <B>pfuTextureManager::unload</B>(pfuTexList  *texList)  unload  a
       texture list from texture memory.  If a default texture is
       associated with this list, it will point the image  point-
       ers  of  all of the list of pfTextures to the default tex-
       ture image.

       <B>pfuTextureManager::loadUnload</B>(pfuTexList  *loadList,  pfu-
       TexList  *unloadList)  effects  a  load of <B>loadlist</B> and an
       unload of <B>unloadList</B> in one  operation.   This  is  useful
       when  <B>loadList</B> and <B>unloadList</B> that have textures in common
       to avoid unloading and reloading the common textures.

       <B>pfuTextureManager::getTextureMemorySize</B>(void) returns  the
       size of texture memory in bytes.

       <B>pfuTextureManager::getTextureMemoryUsage</B>(void) returns the
       size of texture memory in bytes used by  textures  managed
       by the texture manager.

       <B>pfuTextureManager::willFit</B>(pfuTexList  *texList) returns a
       boolean indicating whether <B>texList</B> will all fit in texture
       memory.

       <B>pfuTextureManager::isListLoaded</B>(pfuTexList       *texList)
       returns a boolean indicating  whether  all  pfTextures  in
       <B>texList</B> are loaded in texture memory.

       <B>pfuTextureManager::Print</B>(int level) prints a formated mes-
       sage about managed textures and lists and  is  useful  for
       debuggin  or  observing  the  Texture  Manager's behavior.
       Three levels are currently supported: 1) prints  only  the
       name  of  each texture list, it's overall size and a frac-
       tion indicating the level of residence in texture  memory,
       2)  a more comprehensive list of each list, including sta-
       tus of individual texture on the list, and 3) a more  ver-
       bose description.
