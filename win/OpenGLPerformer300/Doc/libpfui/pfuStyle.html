<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       <B>pfuPreDrawStyle,</B>  <B>pfuPostDrawStyle</B>  - Functions to produce
       fancy drawing styles.


</PRE>
<H2>FUNCTION SPECIFICATION</H2><PRE>
       #include &lt;Performer/pf.h&gt;

       #include &lt;Performer/pfutil.h&gt;

       void   <B>pfuPreDrawStyle</B>(int style, pfVec4 scribeColor);

       void   <B>pfuPostDrawStyle</B>(int style);


</PRE>
<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       <I>style</I>  identifies a drawing style.


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Both <B>pfuPreDrawStyle</B> and <B>pfuPostDrawStyle</B>  use  multi-pass
       rendering  to  implement  special draw styles that are not
       directly provided by the  hardware  or  graphics  library.
       These  effects,  such  as hidden line rendering and haloed
       polygons, can however be achieved with high-performance Z-
       buffered  graphics  rendering  hardware as these functions
       demonstrate.

       <B>pfuPreDrawStyle</B> should be called  in  the  Performer  draw
       callback just before <B>pfDraw</B>. <B>pfuPostDrawStyle</B> must then be
       called after <B>pfDraw</B>. These two functions are  a  pair  and
       both must be called as described.

       The <I>style</I> argument can take the following values.

              <B>PFUSTYLE_POINTS</B>
                   This  causes  polygon  vertices to be drawn as
                   small points.  In many cases, internal  struc-
                   tural aspects can be observed from the result-
                   ing "cloud of points" image,  especially  when
                   that image is in motion on the screen.

              <B>PFUSTYLE_LINES</B>
                   This  causes polygons to be drawn in wireframe
                   mode using the Performer  <B>PFGS_WIREFRAME</B>  draw
                   style.  The  lines are drawn in the same color
                   as the base geometry.

              <B>PFUSTYLE_DASHED</B>
                   This is a wireframe drawing  style  that  does
                   something slightly tricky: it draws the front-
                   facing polygons of an  object  in  the  normal
                   wireframe mode and the back-facing polygons in
                   a dashed line mode, creating a typical drafts-
                   man's  dashed-occlusion  hint  style of hidden
                   line drawing.

              <B>PFUSTYLE_HALOED</B>
                   Appel.

              <B>PFUSTYLE_HIDDEN</B>
                   Hidden  polygons  are  not drawn while visible
                   polygons are drawn in wireframe mode. This  is
                   the  traditional  hidden-line  removal display
                   mode.

              <B>PFUSTYLE_FILLED</B>
                   Draws polygons as filled solids. This  hidden-
                   surface  removal  display mode is the standard
                   display style.

              <B>PFUSTYLE_SCRIBED</B>
                   Polygons are drawn filled with hidden surfaces
                   removed.  The boundary of each visible polygon
                   is highlighted in a wire frame highlight. This
                   mode  can  be very useful in understanding the
                   geometric complexity of textured scenes.

       When   <I>style</I>   takes   the   values   <B>PFUSTYLE_POINTS</B>   or
       <B>PFUSTYLE_DASHED</B>, <B>pfuPostDrawStyle</B> restores polygon drawing
       to the normal filled mode.  Finally, for  every  value  of
       <I>style</I>,  it  restores  the state before <B>pfuPreDrawStyle</B> was
       called.

       The <I>scribeColor</I> argument is the desired color for  scribed
       lines. The first three elements of the array represent the
       red, green, and blue values in the range 0 to 1,  and  the
       final  element  is  the alpha value for the scribed lines.
       This argument is not used in the other style modes.

       The following code fragment displays  how  <B>pfuPreDrawStyle</B>
       and  <B>pfuPostDrawStyle</B> would typically be used in an appli-
       cation. See the files:

       /usr/share/Performer/src/sample/C/perfly.c
       /usr/share/Performer/src/sample/C++/perfly.C

       for details.

       Example 1:

       /* convey draw style from localPreDraw to localPostDraw */
       static int selectedDrawStyle = 0;

       void
       localPreDraw(pfChannel *chan, void *data)
       {
         :
         :
           /*
            * remember draw style in case it changes between now
            * and the time localPostDraw() gets called.
            */
           selectedDrawStyle = ViewState-&gt;drawStyle;

           /* handle draw style */
           pfuPreDrawStyle(selectedDrawStyle, ViewState-&gt;drawColor);

         :
         :
       }
