<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       These routines assign processes to CPUs  and  implement  a
       policy  specifically  designed for locking down the OpenGL
       Performer application, cull, and draw processes.  The rou-
       tines  implementing  these features utilize the IRIX REACT
       facilities.  Refer to the IRIX REACT technical report, and
       the  <B>sysmp(2)</B>  reference  page for detailed information on
       these concepts.

       <B>pfuFreeAllCPUs</B> frees any CPUs which may have  been  previ-
       ously restricted.

       The routine <B>pfuRunProcOn</B> can be used to force a process to
       run on a specified CPU and  does  not  require  super-user
       permission.   This  is often used to force extra processes
       that can run asynchronously from the draw, such  as  those
       receiving and generating input, onto CPU 0 without isolat-
       ing that CPU from standard UNIX scheduling.   <B>pfuRunProcOn</B>
       forces the calling process to run on the specified CPU and
       does not require super-user permission.

       All of the <B>pfuLock&lt;*&gt;</B> routines force a process to  run  on
       the  specified CPU.  They also attempt to isolate the pro-
       cessor to run only those  processes  that  have  specified
       that they must run on that CPU.  Isolating a CPU also pro-
       tects it from seeing unnecessary  cache  and  TLB  flushes
       generated  by  processes that have not specified that they
       must run on this CPU.

<H2>OBSOLETE</H2><PRE>
       The  process  control  functionality   below is considered
       obsolete in Performer 2.2.  It is still provided for  com-
       patibility  had  has been updated to include new processes
       and to use the POSIX scheduling if available on  the  cur-
       rent  system  (requires  6.2  + patch1717, patchset 31 and
       patchset43 or 6.4 or later  version  of  IRIX).   However,
       this  functionality has been obsoleted by the much simpler
       and more extensible <B>pfuProcessManager</B>.

       The <B>pfuLockDown&lt;App,Cull,Draw&gt;</B> routines implement a policy
       for selecting CPUs for different processors given the pro-
       gram and machine configuration.

       The locking and assignment  policy  implemented  by  these
       routines is implemented in the various stages of an OpenGL
       Performer application as follows.

       1. CPU 0 is never isolated.

       2. In the <B>APPCULLDRAW</B> mode, the  processor  assignment  is
       handled by the <B>APP</B> process which takes CPU 1.

       3.  In  the <B>APP_CULLDRAW</B> mode, the processor assignment is
       handled separately by the <B>APP</B> and <B>DRAW</B> processes.

       4. In the <B>APP_CULL_DRAW</B> mode, each process handles itself.

       When there is only one pipe, processors are mapped to pro-
       cesses as follows. If there are three CPUs, each  of  <B>APP,</B>
       <B>CULL</B>  and <B>DRAW</B> gets its own process. If there are only two
       CPUs, <B>APP</B> is put on CPU 0, which is not isolated, and <B>DRAW</B>
       and <B>CULL</B> share CPU 1.  The <B>LPOINT</B> process is given its own
       CPU if there are enough  available  CPUs.   Otherwise,  it
       will be given then last CPU.

       Multipipe mappings are as follows.

       If NumCPUs &gt;= 2 + 2*NumPipes
       then each cull and draw process can have its own CPU, with the application
       getting CPU 1, and UNIX getting CPU 0.

       If NumCPUs == 1 + 2*NumPipes
       then the application shares CPU 0 with UNIX.

       Otherwise, if NumCPUs &gt;= 2 + NumPipes
       then cull and draw processes for each pipe are paired together.

       The LPoint processes are also  given their own CPUs if there are enough
       available CPUs.  Otherwise, they are grouped together on a single CPU,
       their own if there is on extra, else the last CPU.


       If there are fewer CPUs then indicated above, then the
       application is assigned to CPU 0 with UNIX, APP and CULL
       process are paired, and when only one free CPU remains,
       all remaining processes are assigned to the last CPU.

       Each of these routines return 1 if successful and 0 if an
       is one CULL process per pfPipe) to a CPU determined by the
       policy above.  T policy above.  This routine should be
       called from application's <B>pfConfigStage</B> callback for the
       <B>PFPROC_CULL</B> stage.  The CPU is isolated to running only
       processes that have specified that they must run on this
       CPU.  This CPU isolation requires super-user permission.

       <B>pfuLockDownDraw</B> locks the DRAW process of a pfPipe (there
       is one draw process per pfPipe) to a CPU determined by the
       policy above.  This routine should be called from applica-
       tion's <B>pfConfigStage</B> callback for the <B>PFPROC_DRAW</B> stage.
       See the <B>pfConfigStage</B> reference page for more information.
       The CPU is isolated to running only processes that have
       specified that they must run on this CPU.  This CPU isola-
       tion requires super-user permission.

       <B>pfuLockDownLPoint</B> locks the LPOINT process of a pfPipe
       (there up to one optional light point process per pfPipe)
       to a CPU determined by the policy above.  This routine
       should be called from application's <B>pfConfigStage</B> callback
       for the <B>PFPROC_LPOINT</B> stage.  The is isolated to running
       only processes that have specified that they must run on
       this CPU.  This CPU isolation requires super-user permis-
       sion.

       <B>pfuRunDiskProcsOn</B> forces all threads servicing pfQueue's
       to run on a certain cpu.  See the <B>pfQueue</B> man page for how
       pfQueue's can be used to service disk threads.  A value of
       -1 passed as the <I>cpu</I> argument will cause the routine to
       choose cpu 2*NumPipes+3 if it exists or cpu 0 otherwise.

       <B>pfuPrioritizeProcs</B> should be called after <B>pfConfig</B> and
       will set or remove non-degrading priorities from all Per-
       former processes.  <I>pri</I> is a boolean: if TRUE all OpenGL
       Performer processes will be assigned a non-degrading pri-
       ority of NDPHIMAX+2 (see <B>schedctl</B>); if FALSE any non-
       degrading priorities will be removed.  You must have
       super-user permission to enable non-degrading priorities
       but not to remove them.

       If you wish to assign different priorities to different
       processes, simply modify <B>pfuPrioritizeProcs</B> to suit your
       needs.

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Processor lock-down functionality is not currently avail-
       able under Linux.

       Isolating a CPU to specific processes requires super-user
       permission.

       CPU 0 should <I>never</I> be isolated.

       A utility shell script is provided in /usr/share/Per-
       former/src/tools/freeproc that can be run as super-user to
       clean up after a program that exits ungracefully.

       The libpfutil source code, object code and documentation
       are provided as unsupported software.  Routines are sub-
