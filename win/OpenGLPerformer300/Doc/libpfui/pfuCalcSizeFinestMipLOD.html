       <B>pfuCalcSizeFinestMipLOD</B>  -  estimate  min texture LOD that

<H2>FUNCTION SPECIFICATION</H2><PRE>
       #include &lt;Performer/pfutil.h&gt;

       float   <B>pfuCalcSizeFinestMipLOD</B>(pfFrustum *cullFrust,
                 int viewportWidth,         int viewportHeight,
                 float heightAboveTerrain,  float min_dst_dxyz,
                 int maxtexsize)

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>pfuCalcSizeFinestMipLOD</B>  attempts  to  calculate  a  tight
       lower bound on the min (finest) texture mipmap LOD  (level
       of  detail)  that mipmapping hardware will use to render a
       scene, given the view frustum, viewport  size  in  pixels,
       distance from the eye to the closest point (or to bounding
       volume) in object space, a lower bound on the  min  change
       in  texture  coords  (s,t)  per  change  in  object coords
       (x,y,z), and the texture size  (which  is  used  only  for
       clamping the result, which can otherwise be unbounded).

       For  more  explicit details and a description of the algo-
       rithm and its assumptions, see the comment at the  top  of
       the   source   file   /usr/share/Performer/src/lib/libpfu-
       til/mipmin.c.

       The resulting LOD calculated by this  function  is  useful
       for  virtual  clip  texturing,  in  which typically only a
       small fixed number  of  contiguous  texture  LODs  can  be
       accessed  at  a time, and the application has control over
       which LOD that window of contiguous  levels  should  start
       (the  "virtual  LOD  offset").   In such a situation it is
       wise to choose an LOD Offset that is  less  than  the  LOD
       returned  by pfuCalcSizeFinestMipLOD but as close to it as
       possible, so as to maximize the number of levels the hard-
       ware  has to work with and thereby increase the effective-
       ness of mipmapping.

       Typically the LOD calculated by this function is  used  to
       determine  the  <B>minLODTexPix</B>  argument to be passed to the
       <B>pfuCalcVirtualClipTexParams</B>  function  along  with   other
       information about the texture, scene, and eyepoint.

       For  examples  of  various  uses of this function, see the
       sample source code for  the  .spherepatch  and  .ct  scene
       loaders, and the virtcliptex sample program:
              /usr/share/Performer/src/lib/libpfdb/libpfspherepatch/pfspherepatch.C
              /usr/share/Performer/src/lib/libpfdb/libpfct/pfct.C
              /usr/share/Performer/src/sample/pguide/libpf/C/virtcliptex.c

       The  libpfutil  source code, object code and documentation
       are provided as unsupported software.  Routines  are  sub-
       ject to change in future releases.
