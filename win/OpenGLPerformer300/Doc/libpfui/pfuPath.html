<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <B>pfuPath</B> functions provide a simple way to move one  or
       more  simulated  vehicles  or eyepoints along a mathemati-
       cally defined path.  The path is a general series of  arcs
       and line segments.  Once a path is created, it can be fol-
       lowed each simulation frame to provide position and orien-
       tation information.

       <B>pfuNewPath</B>  allocates and initializes a new <B>pfuPath</B> struc-
       ture.  Once the path is opened,  segments  (both  straight
       and   curved)  can  be  added  using  the  <B>pfuAddPath</B>  and
       <B>pfuAddArc</B> commands as described below.  The  initial  path
       speed is set at 1.0 database units per second.

       <B>pfuClosePath</B>  connects  the end point of the final segment
       of path <I>path</I> with the start point of the path's first seg-
       ment.   This creates a closed (also known as looping) path
       that can be followed endlessly. Paths can be  either  open
       the original path definition.

       <B>pfuSharePath</B> creates a new <B>pfuPath</B> structure,  but  causes
       the  linked  list  of  path segments in the path structure
       <I>path</I> to be shared by both old  and  new  path  structures.
       This  allows multiple simulated objects to follow the same
       path without the redundant allocation of path storage, and
       also  allows  changes  to  the  path segment definition to
       effect all <B>pfuPath</B> structures that share it.

       <B>pfuPrintPath</B> prints the path following control information
       for  path  object  <I>path</I>, and then prints the definition of
       each segment in the path  itself.  All  printing  is  done
       using  the  OpenGL  Performer  <B>pfNotify</B>  mechanism  with a
       severity level of <B>PFNFY_DEBUG</B>.

       <B>pfuFollowPath</B> performs the actual simulation of moving  an
       object along the path indicated by <I>path</I>. The <I>seconds</I> argu-
       ment specifies the simulated duration, and  internal  data
       in  the  <B>pfuPath</B>  structure  supplies the speed. From this
       time and speed information, the vehicle's  simulated  dis-
       tance  of  travel  is computed. Then, the vehicle is moved
       this distance along the path segments defined  within  the
       <B>pfuPath</B>   object.  The  resulting  simulated  position  is
       returned in the <B>pfVec3</B> argument <I>where</I> and the  orientation
       of the vehicle is returned in <I>orient</I>.

       <B>pfuAddArc</B>  adds a circular arc path segment to the <B>pfuPath</B>
       structure <I>path</I>. The arc  is  defined  by  the  <I>center</I>  and
       <I>radius</I>  values,  and  a  pair  of <I>angles</I>. The first angle,
       <I>angle[0]</I>, is the start angle for the path, and is a  point
       on  the circle defined by <I>center</I> and <I>radius</I> with the indi-
       cated counterclockwise angle from  the  positive  X  axis.
       The second angle, <I>angle[1]</I>, represents the turn angle, the
       angle between the arc's start and end points  as  measured
       from  the  designated  center  point. Positive turn angles
       indicate counterclockwise turns, and negative angles  rep-
       resent  clockwise turns. An arc from the +X axis to the +Y
       axis would be defined with a start angle of 0 degrees  and
       a  turn  angle of 90 degrees. The same arc in the opposite
       direction of travel is defined by  a  start  angle  of  90
       degrees and a turn angle of -90 degrees.

       <B>pfuAddDelay</B> adds a zero-length segment to <I>path</I> that causes
       the simulated vehicle to stop for  the  <I>delay</I>  seconds  at
       that  point  in  the  path.  Once this much simulated time
       elapses, the simulation will continue with the  next  seg-
       ment  in  the path. Delay segments can be used to simulate
       motor vehicles paused waiting for traffic signals and sim-
       ilar latent delay sources along a path.

       <B>pfuAddFile</B>  adds  a  series  of path segments defined by a
       simple ASCII file format to the  <B>pfuPath</B>  structure  <I>path</I>.
       This  function provides an easy way to load user specified
       paths for vehicles into simulation  applications,  and  is
       used  in  the  popular  SGI "Performer Town" demonstration
       program to load the paths for the truck into the  program.

       <B>pfuAddFillet</B> is used to create circular arcs that join two

              2.   A  fillet request is added using <B>pfuAddFillet</B>.
                   The fillet's radius is defined in this call.

              3.   A second straight segment is added, again with
                   <B>pfuAddPath</B>.  This segment must start where the
                   segment of step one ended.

       When the second segment is added in step three, a test  is
       performed  to see if the first point in the second segment
       has the same X, Y, and Z values as the last point  in  the
       previous  segment. If so, and if there is a fillet request
       between the two segments, then a matching  fillet  of  the
       specified  radius  is computed. In addition, the endpoints
       (and thus  lengths)  of  the  two  straight  segments  are
       adjusted so as to match with the fillet endpoints.

       For example, the request

              line from (0,0) to (1,0)
              fillet of radius 0.25
              line from (1,0) to (1,1)

       will  cause  the fillet arc and line segment lengths to be
       automatically computed as

              line from (0,0) to (0.75,0)
              fillet of radius 0.25 with center  (0.75,0.25)  and
              angles 270 and 90.
              line from (1,0.25) to (1,1)

       This automatic fillet construction is seen to be very con-
       venient once the alternative manual fillet construction is
       attempted.  When  the  fillet radius is too large to allow
       the arc to be created (as would be the case in the example
       above  with  a  radius  greater than one), a fillet is not
       constructed and a sharp turn will exist in the path.

       <B>pfuAddPath</B> adds a straight line segment to <I>path</I>. The  line
       segment  is  defined  as extending from <I>start</I> to <I>final</I>. As
       mentioned above, if the segment preceding the line segment
       is  an unevaluated fillet, and the value of <I>start</I> is equal
       to that of the <I>final</I> point of the segment before the  fil-
       let,  then  an automatic fillet will be constructed if the
       fillet's radius specification  is  sufficiently  small  to
       allow it.

       <B>pfuAddSpeed</B> adds a speed changing segment to <I>path</I>. The new
       speed is indicated by <I>desired</I> and the rate  of  adjustment
       from  the  current path speed to the new speed is given by
       <I>rate</I>.
