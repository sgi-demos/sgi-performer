       image tile data at runtime, to facilitate visual verifica-
       tion  of texel size, tile size, and which mipmap levels of
       detail are being displayed.   Functions  are  provided  to
       gridify  image data that is represented in any of the fol-
       lowing forms:  pfClipTexture,  pfImageCache,  pfImageTile,
       raw  tile in memory, or raw tile in file.  For all but the
       last of these, the image pixels clobbered by the  grid  is
       saved   in  a  compact  form  so  that  the  corresponding
       <B>pfuUnGridify</B> function can retrieve them  and  restore  the
       original  underlying image quickly.  This allows an appli-
       cation to efficiently toggle gridification at runtime.  In
       the sample application perfly, the 'g' key toggles clipmap
       gridification (if the scene contains a clipmap).

       If the image data is in an  RGB  format  (PFTEX_RGBA_8  or
       PFTEX_RGB5_A1),  the  grid  color  is  chosen  as follows,
       depending on the destination clipmap level size:
              cyan     1x1    64x64     4096x4096    262144x262144
              blue     2x2   128x128    8192x8192    524288x524288
              magenta  4x4   256x256   16384x16384  1048576x1048576
              red      8x8   512x512   32767x32768  2097152x2097152
              yellow  16x16 1024x1024  65535x65535  4194304x4194304
              green   32x32 2048x2048 131072x131072 8388608x8388608
       If the data is in luminance (PFTEX_I_8) format,  the  grid
       colors  alternate  between black and white: black for 1x1,
       4x4, 16x16, etc. and white for 2x2, 8x8, 32x32, etc.

       The grid for a pfImageTile or raw memory or file tile con-
       sists of:

              --   A 2-pixel border around the entire tile

              --   A  column  of 4x8-pixel ticks, spaced 8 pixels
                   apart, down the center of the tile vertically,
                   and  a  similar  row of them across the center
                   horizontally

              --   Two columns of 2x4-pixel ticks, spaced 16 pix-
                   els  apart,  at the 1/4 and 3/4 tile position,
                   and similar rows of them.



















       For example, this is the grid overlayed on a 128x128  tile
       (only the upper-left quarter is shown):

       Thus  a  user can look at geometry that is textured with a
       gridified clipmap and deduce the following kinds of infor-
       mation:
              Texel size and size of tiles and imagery in texels:
                     Use the known size of the ticks (4x8  texels
                     and 2x4 texels), the size of the tile border
                     (2 texels wide  around  each  tile,  so  the
                     boundary  line  between  adjacent tiles is 4
                     texels wide), and the spacing between  ticks
                     (little ticks are 16 texels apart, big ticks
                     are 8 texels apart) to measure sizes.
              Which mipmap levels of detail are being displayed:
                     Look it up by color in the table above.  For
                     RGB  data, the colors repeat every 6 levels,
                     so some deduction by other means may be nec-
                     essary (e.g. familiarity with the image data
                     itself,  or  fiddling  with  the  minLOD  or
                     maxLOD  slider).   Usually it is only neces-
                     sary to think hard once  in  order  to  "get
                     one's  bearings"; after that, it is easy see
                     transitions between levels and to figure out
                     the  size of a given level from knowledge of
                     adjacent levels.

              <B>pfuGridifyMem</B>  takes a pointer <I>buf</I> to a tile of raw
              image data of  size  <I>width</I>,<I>height</I>  with  <I>pixeldepth</I>
              bytes  per  pixel,  and  a  given <I>borderwidth</I> (2 is
              standard, but any number can be given; e.g. a value
              larger than width/2 will change the tile to a solid
              color), and gridifies it using the specified  <I>color</I>
              for  the  grid.  If <I>savecolors</I> is not <B>NULL</B>, it must
              be  a  pointer  to  a  buffer  of  size  previously
              returned  by <B>pfuGridifySaveSize</B> to be used for sav-
              ing the image pixels that will get clobbered by the
              grid.    <B>pfuUnGridifyMem</B>   undoes   the  effect  of
              <B>pfuGridifyMem</B>.

              <B>pfuGridifyFile</B> is just  like  <B>pfuGridifyMem</B>  except
              that  it  operates  on  a  raw image tile in a file
              (specified by  <I>filename</I>)  rather  than  in  memory.
              There is no corresponding ungridify function, since
              it is easy enough to simply  save  a  copy  of  the
              original  file.   The  function  return  value is 1
              indicating success, or 0 (and a pfNotify message of
              level  PFNFY_WARN) indicating failure to open, read
              from, or write to the file.

              <B>pfuGridifyFileP</B> is a lower-level interface  to  the
              functionality  of  <B>pfuGridifyFile</B>.   It  takes file
              pointers (<I>infp</I>, <I>outfp</I>) and the input  file  may  be
              different  from  the  output  file.  The parameters
              <I>infilename</I><B>_</B><I>for</I><B>_</B><I>errors</I>  and   <I>outfilename</I><B>_</B><I>for</I><B>_</B><I>errors</I>
              are  used for printing in error messages, should an
              error occur.  The function return value is 1  indi-
              cating  success,  or  0  (and a pfNotify message of
              level PFNFY_WARN) indicating failure to  read  from
              <I>infp</I> or write to <I>outfp</I>.

              <B>pfuGridifyImageTile</B> gridifies the pfImageTile <I>itile</I>
              using a border width of 2 and <I>pixeldepth</I> bytes  per
              pixel (which must be the actual number of bytes per
              pixel in <I>itile</I>), with the given <I>color</I>.  If  <I>isproto</I>
              is FALSE, this means waiting for the tile to become
              valid and then gridifying  the  underlying  memory.
              If  <I>isproto</I>  is true, it means setting the readFunc
              so that all pfImageTiles cloned from itile  in  the
              future will automatically get gridified as they are
              read in from  disk.   <B>pfuUnGridifyImageTile</B>  undoes
              the  effect of <B>pfuGridifyImageTile</B>.  Both functions
              return 1 on success, or 0 (and a  pfNotify  message

              state is encountered (e.g.  trying  to  gridify  an
              already-gridified image cache, or trying to ungrid-
              ify one that has not been gridified).

              <B>pfuGridifyImageCache</B>  gridifies  the  given   image
              cache  <I>icache</I>  by  calling <B>pfuGridifyImageTile</B> with
              the given arguments on the prototype tile  and  all
              tiles  in the cache.  <B>pfuUnGridifyImageCache</B> undoes
              the effect of <B>BpfuGridifyImageCache</B>.  Both function
              return  1  on success, or 0 (and a pfNotify message
              of level PFNFY_WARN) if an error is encountered.

              <B>pfuGridifyAnyClipTexture</B> is a convenience  function
              that  calls  <B>pfuGridifyClipTexture</B> on the <I>i</I>'th tex-
              ture encountered  during  traversal  of  the  scene
              graph  rooted at <I>scene</I>.  <B>pfuUnGridifyAnyClipTexture</B>
              undoes the effect of <B>pfuGridifyAnyClipTexture</B>.

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       In a multiprocess Performer application,  these  functions
       should only be called from the DRAW process.

       While  a pfClipTexture, pfImageCache, or pfImageTile is in
       a gridified state, its user data  is  used  to  store  the
       saved  pixels  and  callback  information, so applications
       cannot use the objects' user data for other purposes.

       The implementation of pfuGridifyImageCache (and thus  also
       pfuGridifyClipTexture  which  uses  it) installs a wrapper
       readFunc on the prototype tile.  This  wrapper  calls  the
       original readFunc and gridifies the data before returning,
       allocating an array to store the saved pixels.  (The  cor-
       responding  pfuUnGridify  functions restore the saved pix-
       els, free the saved pixel array, and restore the  original
       readFunc.)   This  implementation has two important conse-
       quences: first, while an object is in a  gridified  state,
       it  can  incur  per-frame  memory allocations and frees (a
       practice that is frowned upon when trying to achieve  con-
       sistent frame rates).  Second, applications that install a
       custom readFunc must take care to do so *before*  gridify-
       ing  so that the gridification function will wrap it prop-
       erly.

       <B>pfuGridifyMPClipTexture</B> and <B>pfuUnGridifyMPClipTexture</B>  are
       not implemented.

       The  libpfutil  source code, object code and documentation
       are provided as unsupported software.  Routines  are  sub-
       ject to change in future releases.
