<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       These  functions  serve  as  a generic way of initializing
       channels when using the integrated multi-channel  hardware
       available  on  most current SGI platorms, including Reali-
       tyEngine, InfiniteReality, Impact,  Octane  graphics  sys-
       tems.   The  multi-channel  technique  divides  the  frame
       buffer into several tiles and then outputs these different
       tiles  to  different displays through different video out-
       puts.  This allows multiple video  outputs  to  be  driven
       efficiently  by  one pfPipeWindow with multiple pfChannels
       whose viewports match  the  framebuffer  boundaries.   For
       example,  on  RealityEngine,  the MCO can be configured to
       drive up to six display channels  at  resolutions  varying
       from  1280x1024 60Hz non-interlaced to 640x480 30Hz inter-
       laced.  The InfiniteReality has up to eight  channels  per
       single  graphics  pipeline.  Impact and Octane can each do
       four.  These framebuffer boundaries and other  information
       can  be  queried via a pfPipeVideoChannel that is attached
       to the desired hardware video channel.  The utility  func-
       tions use a basic knowledge or queries of how the configu-
       rations tile the  frame  buffer  to  configure  <B>pfChannels</B>
       appropriately  for  most configurations.  For more details
       on video channels, refer  to  the  <B>pfPipeVideoChannel</B>  and
       <B>XSGIvc(3)</B> reference pages.

       <B>pfuConfigMCO</B>  takes the array of <B>pfChannel</B> pointers <I>chn</I> of
       size <I>nChans</I> and formats the viewports such that each chan-
       nel's viewport divides the framebuffer in the same way the
       MCO does.  Each channel is thus mapped to a different dis-
       play.

       <B>pfuGetNumMCOChannels</B>  returns the number of channel subdi-
       visions the MCO is currently configured to use.   This  is
       the  number  of  displays that the MCO has tiled the frame
       buffer into based on the current video output format spec-
       ification (see <B>setmon</B>).

       bottom(<I>b</I>), and top(<I>t</I>) values where each value is between 0
       and  1.  <I>nChans</I>  is usually the number of channel subdivi-
       sions the MCO is configured to use. <I>thisChan</I> should be  at
       most <I>nChans</I>.

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       MCO is not currently supported under Linux.

       The  libpfutil  source code, object code and documentation
       are provided as unsupported software.  Routines  are  sub-
       ject to change in future releases.
