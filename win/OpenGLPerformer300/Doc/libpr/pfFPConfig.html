<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       <B>pfFPConfig,</B>  <B>pfGetFPConfig</B> - Specify floating-point toler-
       ances and exception handling


</PRE>
<H2>FUNCTION SPECIFICATION</H2><PRE>
       #include &lt;Performer/pr.h&gt;

       void    <B>pfFPConfig</B>(int which, float val);

       float   <B>pfGetFPConfig</B>(int which);


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>pfFPConfig</B> allows you to set some tolerances used  by  the
       OpenGL Performer math routines.  The <I>which</I> field specifies
       which floating point attribute is to be set.   <I>val</I>  speci-
       fies  the value that attribute should take. Supported val-
       ues are:

              <B>PFFP_UNIT_ROUNDOFF</B>
                   Specifies the tolerance applied to testing for
                   equality,  usually  scaled by the magnitude of
                   the operand.  The default is 1.0e-5.  For per-
                   formance  reasons,  the  appropriately  scaled
                   tolerance is not used pervasively.

              <B>PFFP_ZERO_THRESH</B>
                   Specifies how large in  magnitude  a  floating
                   point  number  can be before it should be con-
                   sidered non-zero.  The default is 1.0e-15.

              <B>PFFP_TRAP_FPES</B>
                   Enables  and  disables  trapping  of  floating
                   point  exceptions  with  <I>value</I>s  1.0  and 0.0,
                   respectively.  Normally, these floating  point
                   errors  are  handled through kernel exceptions
                   or by the floating point hardware, and may  be
                   nearly invisible to an application except from
                   performance degradation, sometimes  very  sig-
                   nificant, which they can cause.  When enabled,
                   pfNotify events are generated for the floating
                   point  exceptions mentioned above and messages
                   displayed or passed to the user supplied pfNo-
                   tify handler.

       An  application  can also turn on floating point exception
       handling via the general Performer  pfNotify  notification
       mechanism.  Calling  <B>pfNotifyLevel</B> with the <B>PFNFY_FP_DEBUG</B>
       notification level configures <B>pfFPConfig</B> to enable  excep-
       tions.   Alternately,  an appropriate setting of the envi-
       ronment variable <B>PFNFYLEVEL</B> will enable this processing as
       well.  Use  of  the  <B>pfNotifyLevel</B>  function is preferable
       because then the PFNFYLEVEL environment  variable  can  be
       used when necessary to override the specification.
