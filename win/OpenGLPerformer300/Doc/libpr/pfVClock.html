<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A  pfVClock  (Video  Clock)  is  a clock which runs at the
       video retrace rate.  There is one clock for each  hardware
       graphics  pipeline  which  runs  at the video rate of that
       pipeline. A pipeline's video rate is defined by its  video
       format  (see <B>setmon</B>). To access the video clock a Graphics
       Library window must be opened and  made  current  although
       the  window does not need to be mapped to the display sur-
       face (<B>noport</B> in IRIS GL). The screen of the current window
       determines which pipe's video clock is accessed on multip-
       ipe machines.

       <B>pfStartVClock</B> starts  the  video  clock  by  enabling  CPU
       interrupts  from  the graphics pipeline while <B>pfStopVClock</B>
       disables CPU interrupts.  At this time,  the  video  clock
       can be started/stopped only on VGX and VGXT graphics hard-
       ware. On other hardware such as InfiniteReality and Reali-
       tyEngine, CPU interrupts are always enabled.

       <B>pfInitVClock</B>  sets the initial value of the video clock to
       <I>ticks</I>.  Note that <B>pfInitVClock</B>  does  not  set  the  video
       clock,  rather it computes an offset which is added to the
       real video clock's value.  This  offset  is  unique  to  a
       given address space - <B>fork</B>ed processes each have their own
       offset while <B>sproc</B>ed processes share the offset. The  off-
       set    computed    by    <B>pfInitVClock</B>   is   returned   by
       <B>pfGetVClockOffset</B>   and   may   be   set   directly   with
       <B>pfVClockOffset</B>,  simplifying  clock synchronization across
       processes.

       <B>pfGetVClock</B> returns the current video retrace count  rela-
       tive to the initial value set by <B>pfInitVClock</B>.


       If the retrace count modulo <I>rate</I> is equal to <I>offset</I> at the
       time <B>pfVClockSync</B> is called, the caller  will  not  return
       immediately but will go to sleep until <I>rate</I> ticks later.

       The following code fragment illustrates a true video clock
       which will wake up each vertical retrace  period  (subject
       to process priorities):

       while (1)
       {
           /* wait for next vertical retrace */
           pfVClockSync(1, 0);

           /* perform per-interval actions */
            :
       }

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       pfVClock functionality is not currently supported under
       Linux.

       A GL window (which may be a <B>noport</B> window) must be open
       before any pfVClock routines are called.

       The video clock count is *not* the <B>swapbuffers</B> count.
