<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       <I>ws</I>  identifies a pfWSConnection.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       These functions provide a single API for communicating
       with the window system.

       These routines communicate with the window system via a
       <B>pfWSConnection</B> to a window server.  This connection is
       the multiple-keyboard machines.  A pfWSConnection has a
       default screen on which windows will be opened if no other
       screen is explicitly named (such as through <B>pfWinScreen</B>).
       This default screen is determined by the <B>DISPLAY</B> environ-
       ment variable, and is screen 0 if the <B>DISPLAY</B> variable is
       unset.

       A <B>pfWSWindow</B> is a window-server X window.  A <B>pfWSDrawable</B>
       is a window system primitive that may be connected to a GL
       drawing context.  A <B>pfWSDrawable</B> includes Pixmaps.
       <B>pfGLContext</B> is the GL context that is attached to the
       <B>pfWSDrawable</B>.

       Windows have framebuffer resources associated with them,
       such as a zbuffer, stencil planes, and possibly multisam-
       ple buffers.  A framebuffer configuration can be created
       by <B>pfChooseFBConfig</B>, or <B>pfChooseWinFBConfig</B>, and is
       returned in a <B>pfFBConfig</B>.

       <B>pfGetCurWSConnection</B> returns the current connection to the
       window system.  If there is no current open connection,
       one is opened on the default display (using the <B>DISPLAY</B>
       environment variable).

       <B>pfOpenWSConnection</B> opens the window server connection
       named by <I>str</I> and if <I>shared</I> is true, this connection will
       be shared with OpenGL Performer and made the current libpr
       window system connection via a call to
       <B>pfSelectWSConnection</B>.

       <B>pfOpenScreen</B> opens a local window server connection with
       the default screen of <I>screen</I>.  If <I>screen</I> is (-1), the
       default screen as set by the <B>DISPLAY</B> environment variable
       will be used, or screen 0 if this variable is unset. Note
       that all window system connections can communication with
       all screens managed by that window server, regardless of
       the value of the default screen.

       <B>pfSelectWSConnection</B> sets the current OpenGL Performer
       libpr window system connection to be <I>ws</I>. The <B>DISPLAY</B> envi-
       ronment variable for that process will be set to the con-
       nection name for <I>ws</I> using the <B>putenv(3C)</B> command.  This
       window system connection will be that returned by
       <B>pfGetCurWSConnection</B>.

       <B>pfCloseWSConnection</B> will close the specified window server
       connection via XCloseDisplay. If <I>ws</I> was the currently
       selected libpr, window server connection, the current con-
       nection will be reset to NULL.

       <B>pfGetWSConnectionName</B> will return the string name for the
       window system connection.  In the X window system, this
       corresponds to the string returned by the <B>XDisplayString</B>
       call.

       <B>pfGetScreenSize</B> returns the X and Y size of <I>screen</I> for the
       server of the current window system connection in <I>x</I> and <I>y</I>.

       <B>pfGetNumScreenVChans</B> returns the number of active hardware
       <I>screen</I> is (-1), the default screen for the window system
       connection will be used. The attribute tokens and their
       values match the OpenGL GLX tokens (see <B>glXChooseVisual</B>
       for additional information). These tokens and their values
       are (booleans are true if present and should NOT be fol-
       lowed by any values):

            <B>PFFB_USE_GL</B>
                   Boolean, true if present. Use GLX rendering
                   (the default).

            <B>PFFB_BUFFER_SIZE</B>
                   Depth of the color buffer

            <B>PFFB_LEVEL</B>
                   Level in plane stacking.  0 is the main win-
                   dow.  negative numbers are underlay planes,
                   positive numbers are overlay planes.

            <B>PFFB_RGBA</B>
                   Boolean, does RGBA mode if present

            <B>PFFB_DOUBLEBUFFER</B>
                   Boolean, does double buffering if present

            <B>PFFB_STEREO</B>
                   Boolean, does stereo buffering if present

            <B>PFFB_AUX_BUFFERS</B>
                   Number of auxiliary buffers

            <B>PFFB_RED_SIZE</B>
                   Number of red component bits

            <B>PFFB_GREEN_SIZE</B>
                   Number of green component bits

            <B>PFFB_BLUE_SIZE</B>
                   Number of blue component bits

            <B>PFFB_ALPHA_SIZE</B>
                   Number of alpha component bits

            <B>PFFB_DEPTH_SIZE</B>
                   Number of depth bits

            <B>PFFB_STENCIL_SIZE</B>
                   Number of stencil bits

            <B>PFFB_ACCUM_RED_SIZE</B>
                   Number of red accumulation bits

            <B>PFFB_ACCUM_GREEN_SIZE</B>
                   Number of green accumulation bits

            <B>PFFB_ACCUM_BLUE_SIZE</B>
                   Number of blue accumulation bits

            <B>PFFB_ACCUM_ALPHA_SIZE</B>

       The list must be terminated with a <B>NULL</B> or <B>None</B>.  OpenGL
       Performer will try to use a multisample buffer with 8 sam-
       ples per pixel unless the number of samples or number of
       multisample buffers has been explicitly set to 0 in the
       attribute array.  The default Performer framebuffer con-
       figuration looks like:

       static int FBAttrs[] =
       {
           PFFB_RGBA,
           PFFB_DOUBLEBUFFER,
           PFFB_DEPTH_SIZE, 24,
           PFFB_RED_SIZE, 8,
           PFFB_SAMPLES, 8,
           PFFB_STENCIL_SIZE, 4,
           None
       };
