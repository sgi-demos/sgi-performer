<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       pfMemory  is  the  base  class from which all major OpenGL
       Performer classes are derived and is also the type used by
       the  OpenGL  Performer  memory allocation routines such as
       <B>pfMalloc</B> and <B>pfFree</B>.

       Because most OpenGL Performer data structures are  derived
       from  pfMemory,  they  inherit  the  functionality  of the
       pfMemory routines described here.  In practice this  means
       you  can  use the pfMemory routines listed above with most
       any OpenGL Performer object, such as  pfMaterial,  pfList,
       pfFog,  pfFrustum,  pfChannel,  pfGroup, pfGeode or with a
       data pointer returned by <B>pfMalloc</B>.

       pfMemory supports the following:

              1.     Typed data structures.

              2.     Memory arena allocation.

              3.     Memory chunks which know their size.

              4.     Reference counting.

       with only a 4 word overhead.

       Although the OpenGL Performer  general  memory  allocation
       routines  (<B>pfMalloc</B>)  create pfMemories, they return void*
       so the application can treat the allocation as  raw  data.
       Consequently,  all  routines  that  would  normally take a
       pfMemory* take a void* and infer the  pfMemory  handle  so
       that  applications  can treat pfMemory as raw memory. How-
       ever, one caveat is that routines which  take  raw  memory
       such  as  <B>pfGSetAttr</B>  or  <B>pfFree</B>  should  not  be passed a
       pointer to static data since the routines may not be  able
       to  successfully infer the pfMemory handle from the void*.


                ---------------  &lt;------ pfMemory*
               | pfMemory      |
               | header        |
               |               |
                ---------------  &lt;------ void* returned by
               |               |         allocation routines

               |               |
                ---------------


       Routines which convert between pfMemory* and void* are:

              void* -&gt; pfMemory*: <B>pfGetMemory</B>

       routines supports the same feature set including reference
       counts, copy, and delete for pfMemories used as OpenGL
       Performer data types like pfGeoSet as well as for pfMemo-
       ries used as raw data like pfGeoSet attribute arrays.

       <B>pfGetMemoryClassType</B> returns the <B>pfType</B>* for the class
       <B>pfMemory</B>.  The <B>pfType</B>* returned by <B>pfGetMemoryClassType</B> is
       the same as the <B>pfType</B>* returned by invoking <B>pfGetType</B> on
       any instance of class <B>pfMemory</B>.  Because OpenGL Performer
       allows subclassing of built-in types, when decisions are
       made based on the type of an object, it is usually better
       to use <B>pfIsOfType</B> to test if an object is of a type
       derived from a Performer type rather than to test for
       strict equality of the <B>pfType</B>*'s.

       All objects derived from pfMemory have a type identifier
       (pfType*) that is returned by <B>pfGetType</B>

       Example 1: API sharing.

       dcs = pfNewDCS();

       /* pfDCS uses pfGroup routine */
       pfAddChild(dcs, geode);

       /* pfDCS uses pfNode routine */
       pfNodeTravMask(dcs, PFTRAV_ISECT, DCS_MASK, PFTRAV_SELF | PFTRAV_DESCEND, PF_SET);


       Each data type derived from pfMemory has an associated
       routine for getting a pointer to its corresponding pfType,
       e.g.  <B>pfGetDCSClassType()</B> returns the pfType* correspond-
       ing to the pfDCS class.  The exact type of an object is
       tested by comparing its pfType* to that returned by one of
       these <B>pfGet&lt;*&gt;ClassType</B> routines or with the <B>pfIsExactType</B>
       test, e.g.


            if (pfGetType(obj) == pfGetGroupClassType()) ...

            if (pfIsExactType(obj, pfGetGroupClassType())) ...



       But since OpenGL Performer allows subclassing and the cre-
       ation of new types in C++, it's more often desirable to
       know whether a particular object is of a type derived from
       a particular type defined by OpenGL Performer.  In partic-
       ular, exact type tests makes application code more likely
       to fail on scene graphs produced by database loaders that
       use subclassing.  <B>pfIsOfType</B> performs this test and
       returns TRUE if <I>mem</I>'s type is derived from <I>type</I>:

            if (pfIsOfType(obj, pfGetGroupClassType())) ...

       If 'obj' is a pfDCS, then the above conditional would
       evaluate TRUE since pfDCS is derived from pfGroup.

       <B>pfGetTypeName</B> returns a string that identifies the type of
       deletion, since it is highly dangerous to delete a pfMem-
       ory which is still being used, i.e., its reference count
       is greater than 0.

       Reference counts may be incremented and decremented by
       <B>pfRef</B> and <B>pfUnref</B> respectively.  <B>pfGetRef</B> returns the ref-
       erence count of <I>mem</I>.  <B>pfUnrefGetRef</B> decrements the refer-
       ence count and returns the new value, as an atomic opera-
       tion, i.e. it is guaranteed that no other process can
       change the value or free the memory between the decrement
       and the time the value is read.  <B>pfUnrefDelete</B> will decre-
       ment the reference count of <I>mem</I> and delete it if the count
       is &lt;= 0.  Thus it is equivalent to calling <B>pfUnref</B> fol-
       lowed by <B>pfDelete</B>, as an atomic operation.

       <B>pfDelete</B> frees the memory associated with <I>mem</I> if its ref-
       erence count is &lt;= 0.  When an object is freed, it decre-
       ments the reference count of all pfMemories that it once
       referenced and will delete any of these pfMemories with
       reference counts that are &lt;= 0.  Thus, <B>pfDelete</B> will fol-
       low all reference chains until it encounters a pfMemory
       which it cannot delete. Note that the reference count of a
       pfNode is incremented each time it is added as a child to
       a pfGroup. Thus, a pfNode must be removed from all its
       parents before it can be deleted.

       When multiprocessing in a <B>libpf</B> application, pfNodes
       should be <B>pfDelete</B>ed only in the APP or DBASE processes as
       should <B>libpr</B> objects that are referenced directly or indi-
       rectly by pfNodes, like pfGeoSets and pfGeoStates. If you
       wish to delete objects in processes other than the APP or
       DBASE, use <B>pfAsyncDelete</B>.

       Example 2: Deletion


       pfMaterial     *mtl;
       pfTexture *tex;
       pfGeoState     *brickStyle, *woodStyle;
       pfGeoSet  *brickWall, *woodWall;

       mtl = pfNewMtl(arena);

       brickStyle = pfNewGState(arena);
       tex = pfNewTex(arena);
       pfLoadTexFile(tex, "brick.rgb");
       pfGStateAttr(brickStyle, PFSTATE_TEXTURE, tex);
       pfGStateAttr(brickStyle, PFSTATE_FRONTMTL, mtl);

       woodStyle = pfNewGState(arena);
       tex = pfNewTex(arena);
       pfLoadTexFile(tex, "wood.rgb");
       pfGStateAttr(woodStyle, PFSTATE_TEXTURE, tex);
       pfGStateAttr(woodStyle, PFSTATE_FRONTMTL, mtl);

       brickWall = pfNewGSet(arena);
       pfGSetGState(brickWall, brickStyle);
       pfGSetAttr(brickWall, PFGS_COORD3, PFGS_PER_VERTEX, coords);

        * have been deleted. coords and mtl have not been deleted
        * since they are referenced by brickWall and brickStyle respectively.

       <B>pfDelete</B> returns the following:

              tab($) ; c l .  FALSE$<I>mem</I> was not deleted TRUE$<I>mem</I>
              was deleted -1$<I>mem</I> is not a pfMemory

       <B>pfDelete</B> is implemented for all OpenGL Performer objects
       except the following:

              pfPipe
              pfChannel
              pfEarthSky
              pfBuffer
              pfPipeWindow
              pfTraverser
              pfState
              pfDataPool

       <B>pfIsFluxed</B> returns TRUE if a pfMemory is actually the data
       portion of a pfFluxMemory that is part of a pfFlux.  It
       returns FALSE otherwise.  Calling <B>pfRef</B>, <B>pfUnref</B>,
       <B>pfUnrefDelete</B>, <B>pfUnrefGetRef</B>, <B>pfGetRef</B>, or <B>pfDelete</B> on a
       Fluxed pfMemory, will actually call the function on the
       parent pfFlux.

       <B>pfCopy</B> copies <I>src</I> into <I>dst</I>.  <B>pfCopy</B> is not recursive - it
       does not follow reference chains but instead copies only
       the first- level references. The reference counts of
       objects newly referenced by <I>dst</I> are incremented by one
       while those counts of objects previously reverenced by <I>dst</I>
       are decremented by one. Objects whose reference counts
       reach 0 during <B>pfCopy</B> are <I>not</I> deleted.  A value of <B>TRUE</B>
       will be returned if the copy successfully completes and
       <B>FALSE</B> will be returned if an error is encountered.  If the
       destination object is a growable object (such as a <B>pfList</B>)
       then it will automatically grow as needed and as memory
       permits to hold the copy of the source object.  If the
       destination object is not a growable object and the <I>src</I>
       object is larger than the destination object, no copy will
       be done and a value of <B>FALSE</B> will be returned.

       <B>pfCopy</B> is currently not implemented for any libpf data
       structures and is not implemented for the following libpr
       data structures:

              pfState
              pfDataPool

       <B>pfCompare</B> compares the object <I>p1</I> to the object <I>p2</I>.  If the
       objects are identical, a value of 0 will be returned.
       Upon the first difference, a value of (1) will be returned
       if <I>p1</I> had a greater value and a value of (-1) will be
       returned if <I>p2</I> had a greater value.  <B>pfCompare</B> is recur-
       sive on known defined objects and their sub objects but is
       <B>pfPrint</B> Prints information to a file about the specified
       pfMemory <I>mem</I>.  The <I>file</I> argument specifies the file.  If
       <I>file</I> is <B>NULL</B>, the listing is printed to stderr.  <B>pfPrint</B>
       takes a verbosity indicator, <I>verbose</I>.  Valid selections in
       order of increasing verbosity are:

              tab($) ; l l .  <B>PFPRINT_VB_OFF</B>$no printing
              <B>PFPRINT_VB_ON</B>$minimal printing (default)
              <B>PFPRINT_VB_NOTICE</B>$minimal printing (default)
              <B>PFPRINT_VB_INFO</B>$considerable printing
              <B>PFPRINT_VB_DEBUG</B>$exhaustive printing

       If <I>mem</I> is a type of pfNode, then <I>which</I> specifies whether
       the print traversal should only traverse the current node
       (<B>PFTRAV_SELF</B>) or print out the entire scene graph rooted
       by node <I>mem</I> by traversing <I>node</I> and its descendents in the
       graph (<B>PFTRAV_SELF</B> | <B>PFTRAV_DESCEND</B>).  If <I>mem</I> is a
       pfFrameStats, then <I>which</I> specifies a bitmask of frame
       statistics classes that should be printed.  If <I>mem</I> is a
       pfGeoSet, then <I>which</I> is ignored and information about that
       pfGeoSet is printed according to the verbosity indicator.
       The output contains the types, names and bounds of the
       nodes and pfGeoSets in the hierarchy.  This routine is
       provided for debugging purposes only and the content and
       format may change in future releases.

       Example 3: Print entire contents of a pfGeoSet, <I>gset</I>, to
       stderr.

       pfPrint(gset, NULL, PFPRINT_VB_DEBUG, NULL);


       Example 4: Print entire scene graph under node to a file
       <I>file</I> with default verbosity.

       file = fopen ("scene.out","w");
       pfPrint(scene, PFTRAV_SELF | PFTRAV_DESCEND, PFPRINT_VB_ON, fp);
       fclose(file);


       Example 5: Print select classes of a pfFrameStats struc-
       ture, <I>stats</I>, to stderr.

       pfPrint(stats, PFSTATS_ENGFX | PFFSTATS_ENDB | PFFSTATS_ENCULL, PFSTATS_ON, NULL);


       pfMalloc and the related routines provide a consistent
       method to allocate memory, either from the user's heap
       (using the C-library <B>malloc</B> function) or from a shared
       memory arena (using the IRIX <B>amalloc</B> function).  In addi-
       tion, these routines provide a reference counting mecha-
       nism used by OpenGL Performer to efficiently manage mem-
       ory.

       <B>pfMalloc</B> operates identically to the C-library <B>malloc</B>
       function, except that a shared memory arena may be speci-
       fied to allocate the memory from.  If <I>arena</I> is NULL, mem-
       ory is allocated from the heap, otherwise memory is allo-
       cated from <I>arena</I> which must be a previously configured

       In all cases, a pointer to the allocated memory block is
       returned or NULL if there is not enough available memory.

       The data pointer returned by <B>pfMalloc</B>, <B>pfCalloc</B>, and
       <B>pfRealloc</B> is actually part of a pfMemory object that,
       among other things, provides a reference count.  Reference
       counts are used to keep track of how many times each allo-
       cated block of memory is referenced or instanced.  All
       OpenGL Performer libpr objects (pfMemory) are created with
       <B>pfMalloc</B> so their reference counts are updated by appro-
       priate libpr routines. Examples of references follow:

       Example 6:

       tex = pfNewTex(NULL);

       /* Attach 'tex' to gstate0 and gstate1 */
       pfGStateAttr(gstate0, PFSTATE_TEXTURE, tex);
       pfGStateAttr(gstate1, PFSTATE_TEXTURE, tex);

       /* The reference count of 'tex' is now 2 */

       /* Remove 'tex' from gstate1 */
       pfGStateAttr(gstate1, PFSTATE_TEXTURE, NULL);

       /* The reference count of 'tex' is now 1 */


       Example 7:

       coords = (pfVec3*) pfMalloc(sizeof(pfVec3) * numVerts, arena);

       /* Attach 'coords' to non-indexed pfGeoSet, 'gset' */
       pfGSetAttr(gset, PFGS_COORD3, PFGS_PER_VERTEX, coords, NULL);

       /* The reference count of 'coords' is now 1 */


       Example 8:

       /* Attach 'gstate0' to 'gset' */
       pfGSetGState(gset, gstate0);

       /* The reference count of 'gstate0' is now incremented by 1 */


       <B>pfFree</B> frees the memory associated with <I>ptr</I>.  It is an
       error to <B>pfFree</B> memory that was not allocated by <B>pfMalloc</B>,
       <B>pfCalloc</B>, or <B>pfRealloc</B>.  It is also an error to use any
       method other than <B>pfFree</B> or <B>pfDelete</B> to free memory allo-
       cated by <B>pfMalloc</B>, <B>pfCalloc</B>, or <B>pfRealloc</B>.

       <B>pfFree</B> does not honor the reference count of <I>ptr</I>.  This
       means that you can free a chunk of memory that is still
       being used (which means that its reference count is &gt; 0)
       with potentially disastrous results. Typical failure modes
       are in the form of mysterious memory corruption and seg-
       mentation violations.
       more details on <B>pfDelete</B>.

       <B>pfGetArena</B> returns the arena pointer which <I>ptr</I> was allo-
       cated from or NULL if <I>ptr</I> was allocated from the process
       heap.

       <B>pfGetSize</B> returns the size in bytes of the memory refer-
       enced by <I>ptr</I> or 0 if <I>ptr</I> is not a <B>pfMalloc</B> pointer.

       <B>pfGetMemoryArenaBytesUsed</B> returns the number of bytes cur-
       rently allocated from the shared arena.  It takes into
       account all the Performer calls that allocate or free
       shared arena memory (<B>pfMalloc</B>, <B>pfCalloc</B>, <B>pfRealloc</B>,
       <B>pfDelete</B>, <B>pfFree</B>, new on any Performer class, etc).  This
       call is only available in the <I>DEBUG</I> libraries.  It is
       meant for debugging memory leaks and therefore is not nec-
       essary in the optimized libraries. If called with opti-
       mized libraries, it returns (-1). This call makes it eas-
       ier to distinguish between memory leaks and memory frag-
       mentation: If the arena grows but the number of bytes used
       doesn't then the program in question causes memory frag-
       mentation but doesn't leak.

       <B>pfStrdup</B> duplicates the NULL-terminated string <I>str</I> by
       allocating storage in the shared memory arena defined by
       the <I>arena</I> argument.

<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
