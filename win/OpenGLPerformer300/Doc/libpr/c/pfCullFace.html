<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       <B>pfCullFace,</B> <B>pfGetCullFace</B> - Specify face culling mode


</PRE>
<H2>FUNCTION SPECIFICATION</H2><PRE>
       #include &lt;Performer/pr.h&gt;

       void   <B>pfCullFace</B>(int mode);

       int    <B>pfGetCullFace</B>(void);


</PRE>
<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       <I>mode</I>  is a symbolic constant and is one of:

             <B>PFCF_OFF</B>            Face culling is off,

             <B>PFCF_BACK</B>           Polygons  that  are  back-facing
                                 will be culled.

             <B>PFCF_FRONT</B>          Polygons that  are  front-facing
                                 will be culled.

             <B>PFCF_BOTH</B>           Polygons   that  are  front  and
                                 back-facing will be culled.


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>pfCullFace</B> sets the face culling mode  used  to  cull  all
       subsequent  polygons.  A polygon is considered to be back-
       facing if its vertices  are  in  clockwise  order  (screen
       coordinates).   Frontfacing  polygon  vertex  ordering  is
       counterclockwise.

       <B>pfGetCullFace</B> returns the current face culling mode.

       The face culling mode state element is identified  by  the
       <B>PFSTATE_CULLFACE</B>  token.  Use this token with <B>pfGStateMode</B>
       to set the face culling mode  of  a  pfGeoState  and  with
       <B>pfOverride</B>   to  override  subsequent  face  culling  mode
       changes.

       <B>pfCullFace</B> is a display-listable command.  If a pfDispList
       has  been  opened by <B>pfOpenDList</B>, <B>pfCullFace</B> will not have
       immediate effect but will be captured  by  the  pfDispList
       and  will  only  have effect when that pfDispList is later
       drawn with <B>pfDrawDList</B>.

       Example 1:

       /* Set up 'face-culled' pfGeoState */
       pfGStateMode(gstate, PFSTATE_CULLFACE, PFCF_BACK);

       /* Attach gstate to gset */
       pfGSetGState(gset, gstate);

       /* Draw face-culled gset */
       pfDrawGSet(gset);

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Backface culling with <B>pfCullFace</B>(<B>PFCF_BACK</B>) can signifi-
       cantly improve performance for "solid" databases whose
       polygons are oriented consistently and where objects are
       closed.  With these databases you cannot see backfacing
       polygons since they are always obscured by nearer front-
       facing ones.  The graphics hardware can quickly reject
       backfacing polygons so use of backface culling is <I>strongly</I>
       encouraged to increase performance.

       Face culling should be disabled when using two-sided
       lighting, since the two-sided lighting is only useful for
       distinguishing backfacing objects.
