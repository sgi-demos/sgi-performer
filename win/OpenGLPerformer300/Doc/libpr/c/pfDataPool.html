<H2>PARENT CLASS FUNCTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The  OpenGL Performer class <B>pfDataPool</B> is derived from the
       parent class <B>pfObject</B>, so each of these  member  functions
       of class <B>pfObject</B> are also directly usable with objects of
       class <B>pfDataPool</B>.  Casting an object of  class  <B>pfDataPool</B>
       to  an object of class <B>pfObject</B> is taken care of automati-
       cally.  This is also true for casts to objects of ancestor
       classes of class <B>pfObject</B>.

       void          <B>pfUserDataSlot</B>(pfObject *obj,      int slot,
                       void *data);

       int           <B>pfGetGLHandle</B>(pfObject *obj);
       int           <B>pfDeleteGLHandle</B>(pfObject *obj);


       Since the class <B>pfObject</B> is itself derived from the parent
       class  <B>pfMemory</B>,  objects  of class <B>pfDataPool</B> can also be
       used with these functions designed for  objects  of  class
       <B>pfMemory</B>.

</PRE>
<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       <I>dpool</I>  identifies a pfDataPool.


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A pfDataPool is similar to a shared  memory  malloc  arena
       but  adds the ability to lock/unlock pfDataPool memory for
       multiprocessing  applications.   The  datapool   functions
       allow  related  or  unrelated  processes to share data and
       provide a means for locking data blocks to eliminate  data
       collision.  These functions use the shared arena functions
       (see <B>usinit</B>).

       <B>pfCreateDPool</B> creates and returns a  handle  to  a  pfDat-
       aPool.  <I>size</I> is the size in bytes of the pfDataPool.  <I>name</I>
       is the name of the pfDataPool and is also the name of  the
       memory-mapped  file  used by the pfDataPool.  This file is
       created in the directory "/usr/tmp" unless the environment
       variable  <B>PFTMPDIR</B>  is  defined, in which case the file is
       created in the directory named in the <B>PFTMPDIR</B> environment
       variable.   <I>name</I>  should  be  unique  among all pfDataPool
       names and only a single  process  should  create  a  given
       pfDataPool with name <I>name</I>.

       <B>pfGetDPoolClassType</B>  return  the  <B>pfType</B>*  for  the  class
       <B>pfDataPool</B>.  The <B>pfType</B>*  returned  is  the  same  as  the
       <B>pfType</B>* returned by invoking <B>pfGetType</B>  on any instance of
       class <B>pfDataPool</B>.  Because OpenGL  Performer  allows  sub-
       classing  of built-in types, when decisions are made based
       on the type of an object, it  is  usually  better  to  use
       <B>pfIsOfType</B>  to test if an object is of a type derived from
       a Performer type rather than to test for  strict  equality
       another process.  A handle  to  the  found  pfDataPool  is
       returned  or  <B>NULL</B>  if  it  was  not found or could not be
       accessed.

       <B>pfReleaseDPool</B> hides <I>dpool</I> so that no other processes  may
       attach  to  it  although all previously attached processes
       may still access it.  Additionally, a released  pfDataPool
       will  be  removed  from the file system (deleted) once all
       attached processes exit.  <B>pfReleaseDPool</B> returns  <B>TRUE</B>  if
       successful and <B>FALSE</B> otherwise.

       <B>pfDPoolAlloc</B>  returns  a  pointer  to a block of memory of
       <I>size</I> bytes that was allocated out  of  <I>dpool</I>  or  <B>NULL</B>  if
       there is not enough available memory in <I>dpool</I>.  <I>size</I> is in
       bytes and can range from 1 to the size of the  pfDataPool.
       The actual size allocated is always rounded up to the next
       16 byte boundary.  <I>id</I> is an integer  id  assigned  to  the
       block   of   memory  that  is  used  to  reference  it  by
       <B>pfDPoolFind</B>.  Block id's should be unique or  the  results
       are undefined.

       <B>pfDPoolFind</B>  returns  a  pointer  to a block of pfDataPool
       memory which is identified by <I>id</I> or <B>NULL</B>  if  <I>id</I>  was  not
       found.   The  calling process must be attached to the dat-
       apool memory.

       <B>pfDPoolFree</B> frees the memory block previously allocated by
       <B>pfDPoolAlloc</B> and makes it available to be reallocated.

       <B>pfDPoolLock</B>,  <B>pfDPoolSpinLock</B>   and <B>pfDPoolUnlock</B> lock and
       unlock access to a block of  pfDataPool  memory  that  was
       allocated  by  <B>pfDPoolAlloc</B>.   When  the  lock  cannot  be
       acquired, <B>pfDPoolLock</B> yields  the  processor  causing  the
       current  thread  to  block  until  the  lock is available.
       <B>pfDPoolSpinLock</B>  provides more control by accepting  argu-
       ments to control the spinning and blocking.  When <I>block</I> is
       <I>FALSE</I>, <B>pfDPoolSpinLock</B> returns rather  than  yielding  the
       processor if the lock cannot be acquired.  <I>spins</I> specifies
       the number of times to spin before yielding or  returning.
       A  <I>spins</I>  value  of -1 invokes the default, currently 600.
       <B>pfDPoolLock</B> and <B>pfDPoolSpinLock</B> return 1 upon  acquisition
       of  the  lock,  0  upon failure to acquire the lock and -1
       upon error.  <B>pfDPoolUnlock</B> relinquishes the  lock  on  the
       block of memory.

       There  are  a fixed number of locks (currently 4096) allo-
       cated for each pfDataPool and a new lock is consumed  when
       an  allocation in that pfDataPool is first locked.  Subse-
       quent releases and locks do not require further lock allo-
       cations.

       Example:

       typedef struct SharedData
       {
           float a, b, c;
       } SharedData;

       pfDataPool *pool;
        :
       /* write to the DataPool with cooperative mutual exclusion */
       pfDPoolLock((void*)data);
       data-&gt;a = 370.0;
       data-&gt;b = 371.0;
       data-&gt;c = 407.0;
       pfDPoolUnlock((void*)data);


       <B>pfDPoolLock</B> attempts to acquire a hardware lock associated
       with <I>dpmem</I>.  If another process has already acquired the
       lock, the calling process will not return until the lock
       is acquired.  Whether the process blocks or spins is a
       function of the machine configuration.  (see <B>usconfig</B>).
       <B>pfDPoolUnlock</B> unlocks <I>dpmem</I>.  A process which double-trips
       a lock by calling <B>pfDPoolLock</B> twice in succession will
       block until the lock is unset by another process.  A pro-
       cess may unlock a lock that was locked by a different pro-
       cess.  <B>pfDPoolTest</B> returns 0 if <I>dpmem</I> is unlocked and 1 if
       it is locked.

       pfDataPool memory may be accessed without using the lock
       and unlock feature; however this defeats the mutual exclu-
       sion feature provided by pfDataPool functions.

       A data pool must occupy the same range of virtual memory
       addresses in all processes that attach to it.
       <B>pfAttachDPool</B> will fail if something else has already been
       mapped into the required address space, e.g. as a result
       of mmap or sbrk.  To minimize this risk, <B>pfCreateDPool</B>
       tries to place new datapools above the main shared memory
       arena created by <B>pfInitArenas</B>.  The address at which the
       next datapool will be created can be overridden by calling
       <B>pfDPoolAttachAddr</B> with the <I>addr</I> argument specifying the
       desired address.  An <I>addr</I> of NULL tells Performer to
       return to its normal placement efforts.  The next attach-
       ment address is returned by <B>pfGetDPoolAttachAddr</B>.

       In the absence of a shared memory arena created by
       <B>pfInitArenas</B>, <B>pfCreateDPool</B> lets the kernel choose the
       data pool placement.

       Deleting a data pool with <B>pfDelete</B> or  unmaps the data
       pool from virtual memory as well as deleting the pfDat-
       aPool data structure.



</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       pfDataPool functionality is not currently supported under
       the single processor version of Performer on Linux.

       When a datapool is created, a file is created in
       "/usr/tmp" or <B>PFTMPDIR</B>.  The file name will end with the
       string ".pfdpool".  If <B>pfReleaseDPool</B> is not called to
       unlink the datapool, this file will remain in the file
       system after the program exits, taking up disk space.

       When using pfDataPools between unrelated processes, you
       can reduce memory conflicts by having the application that
       amalloc, pfInitArenas, usconfig, usinit, ussetlock,
       ustestlock, usunsetlock
