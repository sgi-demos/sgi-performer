<H2>FUNCTION SPECIFICATION</H2><PRE>
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       #include &lt;Performer/pr.h&gt;

       void           <B>pfFilePath</B>(const char *path);

       void           <B>pfFilePathv</B>(const char *s,  ...);

       const char *   <B>pfGetFilePath</B>(void);

       int            <B>pfFindFile</B>(const char *file,

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>pfFilePath</B>  specifies  one  or more search path locations.
       These locations are directories to be  searched  for  data
       files  by OpenGL Performer applications.  This information
       is used by the <B>pfFindFile</B> function.  The <I>path</I> argument  to
       <B>pfFilePath</B>  is  a  colon  or  semi-colon separated list of
       directory pathnames similar to the <B>PATH</B> environment  vari-
       able.  Here is a simple example:

       pfFilePath("/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin");


       <B>pfFilePathv</B> performs the same operation as <B>pfFilePath</B> but
       uses a NULL terminated string in lieu of a colon or semi-
       colon separated string. Using <B>pfFilePathv</B>, the example
       above could be re-written as:

       pfFilePathv("/usr/bin", "/usr/sbin", "/usr/local/bin", NULL):


       Using <B>pfFilePathv</B> ensures that the proper path separator
       token gets inserted depending on the target platform. Note
       that a maximum of 64 paths may be specified using this
       function.

       <B>pfGetFilePath</B> returns the path list set using <B>pfFilePath</B>
       or <B>NULL</B> if no path has yet been set.  The string returned
       is identical in format to the one set via <B>pfFilePath</B>; each
       of the directory names is colon or semi-colon separated.

       <B>pfFindFile</B> attempts to find <I>file</I> amongst the paths set in
       the environment variable <B>PFPATH</B> and by <B>pfFilePath</B>.  It
       also tests the file's access mode against the <I>amode</I> argu-
       ment.  OpenGL Performer routines which access files use
       <B>pfFindFile</B>.

       The <B>PFPATH</B> environment variable is interpreted in the same

              1.   First the file is sought exactly as named by
                   <I>file</I>.  If it exists and passes the subsequent
                   access test described below, then <I>file</I> will be
                   returned in the <I>path</I> argument.

              2.   If the file was not found or was not accessi-
                   ble, then each of the locations defined by the
                   <B>PFPATH</B> environment variable are prepended to
                   the <I>file</I> argument and tested.  If it exists
                   and passes the subsequent access test
                   described below, then the complete path name
                   will be returned in the <I>path</I> argument.

              3.   If the file has still not been successfully
                   located, then each of the locations defined by
                   the most recent call to <B>pfFilePath</B> will be
                   prepended to the <I>file</I> argument and tested.  If
                   it exists and passes the subsequent access
                   test described below, then the complete path
                   name will be returned in the <I>path</I> argument.

              4.   If all of these efforts are fruitless, then
                   <B>pfFindFile</B> will give up and return a NULL
                   string in the <I>path</I> argument.

       The mere existence of <I>file</I> in one of the indicated direc-
       tories is not sufficient, the file must also be accessible
       in the access mode defined by <I>amode</I>.  This mode is a bit-
       field composed by OR-ing together the permission
       attributes defined in <I>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</I> and listed in the follow-
       ing table:

       center tab($) ; c | c | c cB | c | l .  Mode Token$Mode
       Value$Action _ R_OK$0x4$Read permission W_OK$0x2$Write
       permission X_OK$0x1$Execute and search F_OK$0x0$Existence
       of file

       If the bits set in  <I>amode</I> are also set in the file's
       access permission mode, then the complete path is copied
       into <I>path</I> and <B>TRUE</B> is returned indicating success.  If the
       access modes are not similar, then the search continues
       until there are no more paths to search and <B>FALSE</B> is
       returned indicating failure.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       <B>pfCreateFile</B> and <B>pfOpenFile</B> do not use <B>pfFindFile</B>.  This
       is because the search implied can be unpredictably slow
       when remote directories are present in the search path.
