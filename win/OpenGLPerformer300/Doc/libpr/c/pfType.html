       pfType *       <B>pfNewType</B>(pfType *parent, char *name);

       const char *   <B>pfGetTypeName</B>(void* type);

       pfType *       <B>pfGetTypeParent</B>(pfType* type);

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Objects  derived  from pfMemory have an associated pfType.
       An object's pfType* is returned by calling pfGetType.

       <B>pfGetTypeParent</B> returns the parent class  of  the  pfType.
       Note  that  Performer only uses single inheritance and the
       type system only maintains a single inheritance chain.

       <B>pfGetTypeName</B> returns the name of the class.

       <B>pfIsDerivedFrom</B> tests  whether  the  pfType  has  <I>ancestor</I>
       somewhere in its inheritance ancestry.  It returns TRUE if
       the ancestor was found, and FALSE otherwise.

       The type system  must  be  initialized  in  shared  memory
       before other processes that will share the type system are
       created.  When the type system is initialized  by  <B>pfInit</B>,
       each Performer class creates a type for itself.  <B>pfNewType</B>
       allows an application to add additional types to the  type
       system.  <I>parent</I> specifies the parent class, or NULL if the
       class has no parents.  <I>name</I> is the name of the class.

       <B>pfMaxTypes</B> allows an application to increase the number of
       allowed  types.  This must be called before <B>pfInit</B> to have
       effect.

       pfMemory also has two  convenience  functions  <B>pfIsOfType</B>,
       <B>pfGetTypeName</B> that allow access to type information with a
       single call.

       Because OpenGL Performer allows  subclassing  of  built-in
       types,  when  decisions  are  made based on the type of an
       object, it is usually better  to  use  <B>pfIsDerivedFrom</B>  or
       <B>pfIsOfType</B>  to  test  the type of an object rather than to
       test for the strict equality of the <B>pfType</B>*'s.
