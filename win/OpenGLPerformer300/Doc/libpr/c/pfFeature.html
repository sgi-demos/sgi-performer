<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       OpenGL Performer make runtime determinations regarding the
       existence  and relative speed of certain graphics features
       for the underlying graphics library (OpenGL) on  the  cur-
       rent  hardware configuration.  These functions provide the
       ability to both query these results, and to  override  the
       existence  of a given feature.  OpenGL Performer makes use
       of the following useful routines in determining its infor-
       mation:         <B>getgdesc(3g)</B>,        <B>XGetVisualInfo(3X11)</B>,
       <B>glGetString(3g)</B>,     <B>glXQueryExtensionsString(3g)</B>,     and
       <B>getinvent(3)</B>.

       <B>pfQueryFeature</B>  takes a <B>PFQFTR_</B> token and returns in <I>dst</I> a
       token that indicates whether or not  that  feature  exists
       and  whether  the  feature is reasonable to use in a real-
       time application.  The return value is the number of bytes
       successfully written.  The tokens are documented below and
       special note is made  where  performance  is  commonly  an
       issue.  These <B>pfQueryFeature</B> return values will be one of:

              <B>PFQFTR_FALSE</B>
                     indicates that the feature is not  available
                     on the current hardware configuration.

              <B>PFQFTR_TRUE</B>
                     indicates  that  the feature is available on
                     the current hardware configuration.

              <B>PFQFTR_FAST</B>
                     indicates that the feature is reasonable for
                     real-time on the current hardware configura-
                     tion.

       The <B>pfQueryFeature</B> tokens must be one of:

                     queries the support and relative performance
                     of image data in the ABGR format.  This for-
                     mat  may  be  slow  or  unsupported  in some
                     OpenGL implementations.  This is relevant to
                     the OpenGL <B>glDrawPixels(3g)</B> command.

                     queries the support for and relative perfor-
                     mance of transparency.
                     performance of antialiased points.

              <B>PFQFTR_FOG_SPLINE</B>
                     queries the support for spline fog.  See the
                     <B>pfFog</B> man page for more information.

              <B>PFQFTR_FOG_LAYERED</B>
                     queries  the  support  for layered fog using
                     special OpenGL extensions.

              <B>PFQFTR_ALPHA_FUNC</B>
                     queries the  support  for  alpha  functions.
                     See  the <B>pfAlphaFunc</B> man page and the OpenGL
                     <B>glBlendFunc(3g)</B> man pages for more  informa-
                     tion.

              <B>PFQFTR_ALPHA_FUNC_COMPARE_REF</B>
                     queries  the  support  for comparative alpha
                     functions.  See the <B>pfAlphaFunc</B> man page for
                     more information.

              <B>PFQFTR_BLENDCOLOR</B>
                     queries  the  support for specification of a
                     blend color to  use  with  alpha  functions.
                     Refer     to     the     OpenGL    extension
                     <B>glBlendColor(3g)</B> for more information.

              <B>PFQFTR_BLEND_FUNC_SUBTRACT</B>
                     queries the support for  additional  differ-

              <B>PFQFTR_GLSPRITE</B>
                     queries the  existence  of  GL  support  for
                     sprites  (billboards).  This can mean faster
                     billboard drawing and also allows  for  cor-
                     rect  rendering  of billboards in GL display
                     lists.  See the pfSprite and pfBillboard man
                     pages for more information.

              <B>PFQFTR_DVR</B>
                     queries the support for dynamic video resiz-
                     ing, useful for load management of fill lim-
                     ited       applications.        See      the
                     <B>pfPipeVideoChannel</B> man page for more  infor-
                     mation.

              <B>PFQFTR_TEXTURE</B>
                     queries the support and relative performance
                     of texture mapping.

              <B>PFQFTR_TEXTURE_16BIT_IFMTS</B>
                     queries the support and relative performance
                     of 16-bit texel formats.  These formats take
                     up less texture memory  and  can  provide  a
                     significant  performance  improvement at the

              <B>PFQFTR_TEXTURE_TRILINEAR</B>
                     queries the support for trilinear MIPmapping
                     for minification filtering of texture  maps.

              <B>PFQFTR_TEXTURE_DETAIL</B>
                     queries  the support for detailing of magni-
                     fied texture maps.  See the <B>pfTexFilter</B>  and
                     <B>pfTexDetail</B>  man pages for more information.

              <B>PFQFTR_TEXTURE_SHARPEN</B>
                     queries the support for sharpening of magni-
                     fied  texture maps.  See the <B>pfTexFilter</B> man
                     page for more information.

              <B>PFQFTR_TEXTURE_3D</B>
                     queries the  support  for  three-dimensional
                     textures.

              <B>PFQFTR_TEXTURE_5551</B>
                     queries  whether  graphics hardware supports
                     the        5551        texture        format
                     (PFTEX_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_5_5_1).

              <B>PFQFTR_TEXTURE_PROJECTIVE</B>
                     queries  the  support for projected textures
                     (lights). Projected shadows  also  need  the
                     TEXTURE_SHADOW feature.

              <B>PFQFTR_TEXTURE_MINFILTER_BILINEAR_CMP</B>
                     queries  the  support  for  special bilinear
                     LEQUAL/GEQUAL minification filters for doing
                     real-time  shadows.   <B>PPFQFTR_TEXTURE_SHADOW</B>
                     queries  the  support  for  shadow   texture
                     extension.

              <B>PPFQFTR_SHADOW_AMBIENT</B>
                     queries   support  for  the  shadow  ambient
                     color. This corresponds to  the  PFLS_INTEN-
                     SITY value on a pfLightSource.

              <B>PFQFTR_TEXTURE_CLIPMAP</B>
                     queries  the support of clipmapping, or vir-
                     tual MIPmapping, for the  minification  fil-
                     tering of very large textures.

              <B>PFQFTR_TEXTURE_LOD_RANGE</B>
                     queries  the  support  of  texture LOD range
                     control for selecting which  texture  levels
                     are to be used.

              <B>PFQFTR_TEXTURE_LOD_BIAS</B>
                     queries the support of texture LOD bias con-
                     trol.

              <B>PFQFTR_READ_MSDEPTH_BUFFER</B>
                     queries the support for reading  the  multi-
                     sample depth buffer.


              <B>PFQFTR_COPY_TEXTURE_MEMORY</B>
                     queries the support for copying to/from tex-
                     ture memory.

              <B>PFQFTR_MTL_CMODE</B>
                     queries the support and  speed  of  material
                     color mode. On most graphics platforms, this
                     mode yields significant performance improve-
                     ments  for management of multiple materials.
                     However, on some older low-end platforms, it
                     can  have  additional cost and should not be
                     used if multiple materials are not in  used.

              <B>PFQFTR_LIGHT_ATTENUATION</B>
                     queries the support for light attenuation on
                     the  light.   This  is  OpenGL  style  light
                     attenuation.        See      the      OpenGL
                     <B>glLightModel(3g)</B> man page for more  informa-
                     tion.

              <B>PFQFTR_LIGHT_CLR_SPECULAR</B>
                     queries  the support for specular color com-
                     ponents on lights.  This is  only  supported
                     in  OpenGL.   See the OpenGL <B>glLight(3g)</B> man
                     page for more information.

              <B>PFQFTR_CALLIGRAPHIC</B>
                     queries the support  for  calligraphic  sup-
                     port.  This is to know if the Graphic Pipe Z
                     buffer can be used for  calligraphics  light
                     points,  but  it doesn't tell you if a board
                     is connected to the system.

              <B>PFQFTR_DECAL_PLANE</B>
                     queries  the  support  for  decal  reference
                     planes  for  use  with  pfLayers and pfDecal
                     geometry.

              <B>PFQFTR_PIPE_STATS</B>
                     queries the hardware  support  for  graphics
                     pipeline  statistics.   The  InfiniteReality
                     graphics subsystem supports time  stamps  in
                     the graphics pipeline.

              <B>PFQFTR_TEXTURE_ANISOTROPIC</B>
                     queries the hardware support for anisotropic
                     texture filtering.


              <B>PFQFTR_STIPPLE</B>
                     queries the  hardware  for  stipple  pattern
                     support.  All  OpenGL platforms provide this
                     feature, but it is a huge performance hit on
                     some.  Performer  will return <B>PFQFTR_FAST</B> on
                     platforms where this feature is known to  be
                     cheap and <B>PFQFTR_TRUE</B> otherwise.

              <B>PFQFTR_REGISTER_COMBINERS</B>

       successfully written.  This routine is more efficient than
       <B>pfQueryFeature</B> if multiple queries are desired.

       <B>pfFeature</B> takes a <B>PFFTR_</B> token <I>which</I> and a  boolean  value
       <I>val</I> and allows the overriding of OpenGL Performer's deter-
       mination of the existence of certain features.   This  can
       force  OpenGL  Performer  to use, or to stop using, a spe-
       cific feature.  This is useful for running on new graphics
       platforms  that  may  have considerations that OpenGL Per-
       former did not predict, or for making one  machine  behave
       like  another for a specific feature.  Note that if a par-
       ticular feature is forced on and  it  happens  to  require
       hardware  support that does not exist, the program may not
       run.  The features that may be set are:
