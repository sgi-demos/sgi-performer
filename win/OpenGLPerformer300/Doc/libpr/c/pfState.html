<H2>PARENT CLASS FUNCTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The OpenGL Performer class <B>pfState</B>  is  derived  from  the
       parent  class  <B>pfObject</B>, so each of these member functions
       of class <B>pfObject</B> are also directly usable with objects of
       class  <B>pfState</B>.   Casting an object of class <B>pfState</B> to an
       object of class <B>pfObject</B> is taken care  of  automatically.
       This is also true for casts to objects of ancestor classes
       of class <B>pfObject</B>.

       void          <B>pfUserDataSlot</B>(pfObject *obj,      int slot,
                       void *data);
       void          <B>pfUserData</B>(pfObject *obj, void *data);
       void*         <B>pfGetUserDataSlot</B>(pfObject *obj, int slot);
       void*         <B>pfGetUserData</B>(pfObject *obj);

       Since the class <B>pfObject</B> is itself derived from the parent
       class <B>pfMemory</B>, objects of class <B>pfState</B> can also be  used
       with   these  functions  designed  for  objects  of  class
       <B>pfMemory</B>.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       OpenGL  Performer manages a subset of the graphics library
       state for convenience and improved  performance.  Further,
       this state is conceptually partitioned into two divisions:
       modes and attributes.  A mode is a simple  "setting"  usu-
       ally represented by a single value while an attribute is a
       larger collection of related modes that is encapsulated in
       an OpenGL Performer structure, such as <B>pfFog</B>.

       Modes  usually have two routines to set and get them while
       attributes have many routines for accessing their  parame-
       ters   and   a  <B>pfApply&lt;*&gt;</B>  routine  which  "applies"  the
       attribute's characteristics to  the  graphics  system  via
       graphics library state commands.  Modes are represented by
       basic data types like 'int' and 'float'  while  attributes
       are  pointers  to opaque OpenGL Performer structures whose
       contents are accessible only through function calls.

       An  example  of  a  mode  is  the  shading  model  set  by
       <B>pfShadeModel</B>  and an attribute is exemplified by a pfMate-
       rial which is applied  with  <B>pfApplyMtl</B>.   Each  mode  and
       attribute is identified by a <B>PFSTATE_</B> token.  These tokens
       are used in <B>pfGStateMode</B> and <B>pfGStateAttr</B> when  initializ-
       ing  a  pfGeoState  and in <B>pfOverride</B> to override mode and
       attribute settings.









       The following table lists the state  components  that  are
       modes.

       State values may be established within  libpr  in  one  of
       three ways:

              1.   Immediate mode

              2.   Display list mode

              3.   pfGeoState mode

       Like the graphics library itself, OpenGL Performer has two
       command execution modes: immediate mode and  display  list
       mode.   In  immediate  mode,  the setting of a mode or the
       application of an attribute is  carried  out  immediately.
       Any  geometry  rendered afterwards will be drawn with that
       mode or attribute characteristics.  In display list  mode,
       the  command  will  be "captured" by the open display list
       (pfDispList) and will not have effect  until  the  display
       list is closed and later drawn with <B>pfDrawDList</B>.

       All  the  routines listed in Table 1 are display-listable,
       which is to say that they will  be  captured  by  an  open
       that neither a graphics context nor  pfState  is  required
       when  drawing  in  display  list mode because the commands
       will be captured by the display list.

       Example 1:

       /* Enable wireframe in immediate mode */
       pfEnable(PFEN_WIREFRAME);

       /* Draw 'gset' in wireframe */
       pfDrawGSet(gset);


       Example 2:

       /* Enter display list mode by opening 'dlist' for appending */
       pfOpenDList(dlist);
       pfEnable(PFEN_WIREFRAME);
       pfDrawGSet(gset);
       pfCloseDList();

       /* Draw 'gset' in wireframe */
       pfDrawDList(dlist);


       It is important to realize that OpenGL Performer display
       lists (pfDispLists) are different from graphics library
       display lists.  A pfDispList captures only <B>libpr</B> commands
       and does not contain low-level geometric information like
       vertex coordinates and colors.

       The pfGeoState encapsulates all of libpr state, i.e. it
       has all mode settings and a pointer to a definition for
       each attribute type.  Through <B>pfGStateMode</B> and
       <B>pfGStateAttr</B> it is possible to set every state element of
       a pfGeoState.  When the pfGeoState is applied through
       <B>pfApplyGState</B> all the state settings encapsulated by the
       pfGeoState become active.  pfGeoStates also have useful
       inheritance properties that are discussed in the
       pfGeoState man page.  Typical use of a pfGeoState is to
       "build" it at database initialization time and attach it
       to a pfGeoSet (<B>pfGSetGState</B>).  In this way the pfGeoState
       defines the graphics state of the geometry encapsulated by
       the pfGeoSet (pfDrawGSet will call <B>pfApplyGState</B> if the
       pfGeoSet has an attached pfGeoState).

       Example 3:

       /* Set up wireframe pfGeoState */
       gstate = pfNewGState(NULL);
       pfGStateMode(gstate, PFSTATE_ENWIREFRAME, PF_ON);

       /* Draw wireframe pfGeoSet in "pfGeoState" mode */
       pfApplyGState(gstate);          /* Apply 'gstate' */
       pfDrawGSet(gset);               /* Draw 'gset' in wireframe */

       /* Preferred method for drawing wireframe pfGeoSet */
       pfGSetGState(gset, gstate);     /* Attach 'gstate' to 'gset' */
       pfDrawGSet(gset);               /* Draw 'gset' in wireframe */
       before calls to <B>sproc</B> or <B>fork</B> that will generate other
       processes using OpenGL Performer state, with an arena
       which is shared by all application processes.  In either
       single or multi-process operation, <B>pfInitState</B> must be
       called before any state attributes such as pfTextures are
       created and should only be called once.

       <B>pfNewState</B> creates and returns a handle to a pfState.
       <I>arena</I> specifies a malloc arena out of which the pfState is
       allocated or <B>NULL</B> for allocation off the process heap.
       pfStates can be deleted with <B>pfDelete</B>.  Specifically, a
       pfState has a stack of state structures that shadow OpenGL
       Performer and graphics library state.  This stack may be
       manipulated by routines described below.

       <B>pfGetStateClassType</B> returns the <B>pfType</B>* for the class
       <B>pfState</B>.  The <B>pfType</B>* returned by <B>pfGetStateClassType</B> is
       the same as the <B>pfType</B>* returned by invoking <B>pfGetType</B> on
       any instance of class <B>pfState</B>.  Because OpenGL Performer
       allows subclassing of built-in types, when decisions are
       made based on the type of an object, it is usually better
       to use <B>pfIsOfType</B> to test if an object is of a type
       derived from a Performer type rather than to test for
       strict equality of the <B>pfType</B>*'s.

       A pfState should be created for each graphics context that
       the process draws to with libpr routines.  When a process
       switches graphics contexts it should also switch to the
       corresponding pfState with <B>pfSelectState</B>.

       <B>pfSelectState</B> makes <I>state</I> the current state.  pfState is a
       global value so it is shared by all share group pro-
       cesses(See <B>sproc</B>).  <B>pfSelectState</B> should be used when
       switching between different graphics contexts.  It does
       not configure the graphics context with its state set-
       tings.  <B>pfGetCurState</B> returns a pointer to the current
       pfState or NULL if there is no active pfState.

       Each pfState structure maintains a 64-deep stack of
       pfGeoStates.  A pfGeoState shadows all libpr modes and
       attributes.  Changes to the current state made through any
       of the 3 methods listed above are recorded in the top of
       the pfGeoState stack.  <B>pfGetState</B> copies the top of the
       pfGeoState stack into <I>gstate</I>.

       <B>pfPushState</B> pushes the pfGeoState stack of the current
       pfState.  When pushed, the configuration of the current
       state is recorded so that when popped, that state will be
       restored, overwriting any state changes made between push
       and pop.  The bit vector which represents state elements
       that are overridden by <B>pfOverride</B> is also pushed.

       <B>pfPopState</B> compares the current pfGeoState with that of
       the previously pushed pfGeoState and calls graphics
       library routines to restore the previously pushed state.
       The override bit vector is popped before popping any state
       elements.  State changes made to a graphics context must
       be made using the OpenGL Performer for <B>pfPushState</B> and
       <B>pfPopState</B> to work correctly.  Calls made by the applica-
       For performance, state is not actually popped unless a
       subsequent pfGeoState requires it.  This means that in-
       between pfGeoStates, the state may not be what the appli-
       cation expects.  <B>pfFlushState</B> will return the state to the
       global default.(See pfGeoState for more on state flush-
       ing).  <B>pfPushState</B> calls <B>pfFlushState</B>.

       <B>pfPixScale</B> sets <I>scale</I> as the value to be used in scaling
       point and line width specifications. Global control of
       this scale factor is important when Dynamic Video Resolu-
       tion is in use, since points and lines must be reduced in
       width as much as they are enlarged by the video output
       system in order that the displayed geometry have the des-
       ignated width in display-pixel units. <B>pfGetPixScale</B>
       returns the current pixel scale value.

       <B>pfBasicState</B> is a convenience routine for disabling all
       modes and is useful for drawing things like text which
       usually should not be lit or fogged.  Specifically,
       <B>pfBasicState</B> is equivalent to the following:

       /* return graphics pipeline to basic state */
       pfDisable(PFEN_FOG);
       pfDisable(PFEN_LIGHTING);
       pfDisable(PFEN_TEXTURE);
       pfDisable(PFEN_WIREFRAME);
       pfDisable(PFEN_COLORTABLE);
       pfDisable(PFEN_HIGHLIGHTING);
       pfDisable(PFEN_LPOINTSTATE);
       pfDisable(PFEN_TEXGEN);
       pfDisable(PFEN_TEXMAT);

       pfShadeModel(PFSM_GOURAUD);
       pfAlphaFunc(0, PFAF_OFF);
       pfCullFace(PFCF_OFF);
       pfTransparency(PFTR_OFF);

       if (multisampling-type antialiasing is not enabled)
           pfAntialias(PFAA_OFF);

       pfDecal(PFDECAL_OFF);


       Use <B>pfMakeBasicGState</B> to configure every state element
       (value, mode, and attribute) of <I>gstate</I> to be identical to
       the state set with <B>pfBasicState</B>.  The following code frag-
       ment is equivalent to <B>pfBasicState</B>:


       pfGeoState *gstate = pfNewGState(NULL);
       pfMakeBasicGState(gstate);
       pfLoadGState(gstate);


       Each of <B>pfSelectState</B>, <B>pfPushState</B>, <B>pfPopState</B>,
       <B>pfFlushState</B>, and <B>pfBasicState</B> are display-listable com-
       mands.
