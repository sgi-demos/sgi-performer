<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       <I>dlist</I>  identifies a pfDispList.


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A pfDispList is a reusable display list that captures cer-
       tain libpr commands.  <B>pfNewDList</B> creates and returns a
       handle to a new pfDispList.  The arguments specify the
       type and size of the display list.  pfDispLists can be
       deleted with <B>pfDelete</B>.

       <I>type</I> is a symbolic token that specifies a type of pfDis-
       pList and is either <B>PFDL_FLAT</B> or <B>PFDL_RING</B>.  A <B>PFDL_FLAT</B>
       display list is a linear list of commands and data while a
       <B>PFDL_RING</B> is configured as a ring buffer (FIFO).  A ring
       buffer is provided for multiprocessed paired producer and
       consumer applications where the producer writes to the
       buffer while the consumer simultaneously reads from, and
       draws the buffer.  OpenGL Performer automatically ensures
       ring buffer consistency by providing synchronization and
       mutual exclusion to processes on ring buffer full or empty
       decisions are made based on the type of an object, it is
       usually better to use <B>pfIsOfType</B>to test if an object is of
       a type derived from a Performer type rather than to test
       for strict equality of the <B>pfType</B>*'s.

       The <I>size</I> argument to <B>pfNewDList</B> gives a hint in words
       about how much storage the pfDispList will require.  If
       more storage is required, OpenGL Performer will automati-
       cally grow the pfDispList by <I>size</I> words at a time.  <I>arena</I>
       specifies the malloc arena out of which the pfDispList is
       allocated or NULL for allocation off the heap.
       <B>pfGetDListSize</B> returns the size of <I>dlist</I> that was
       requested by <B>pfNewDList</B>, not its current size.

       <B>pfOpenDList</B> opens <I>dlist</I> for appending and puts the calling
       process into display list mode.  When in display list
       mode, display-listable <B>libpr</B> commands are recorded in the
       currently active display list rather than being executed
       immediately.  libpr commands that may be recorded in a
       pfDispList say so in their respective man pages.  Only one
       pfDispList may be open at a time.  <B>pfGetCurDList</B> returns
       the currently active display list or <B>NULL</B> if the calling
       process is in immediate mode.

       The currently active pfDispList is a global value but is
       stored in the PRDA process header so that <I>share</I> <I>group</I> <I>pro-</I>
       <I>cesses</I> (see <B>sproc</B>) need not share the same currently
       active pfDispList.

       The contents of one pfDispList may be appended to a second
       pfDispList with the function <B>pfAppendDList</B>.  All pfDis-
       pList elements in <I>src</I> are appended to the pfDispList
       <I>dlist</I>.

       Each pfDispList maintains head and tail pointers that
       indicate where in the list commands are to be appended and
       evaluated respectively.  Commands entered into the display
       list are appended after the head pointer and increment the
       head pointer appropriately.  Commands drawn by <B>pfDrawDList</B>
       increment the tail pointer but do not remove commands from
       the list.  In the <B>PFDL_RING</B> case, OpenGL Performer ensures
       that the tail pointer does not overrun the head pointer
       and vice versa by spinning processes.

       Both head and tail pointers are reset to the beginning of
       the pfDispList by <B>pfResetDList</B> so that any additions to
       the current pfDispList will overwrite previously entered
       commands.  The tail pointers of flat lists are automati-
       cally reset by <B>pfDrawDList</B> when the tail pointer reaches
       the head pointer so that the pfDispList may be rendered
       again from the beginning.

       <B>pfCloseDList</B> 'closes' the active pfDispList and returns
       the application to immediate mode.

       For <B>PFDL_FLAT</B> display lists, <B>pfDrawDList</B> traverses <I>dlist</I>
       from the tail to the head pointer, and then resets the
       tail pointer to the beginning of <I>dlist</I>.  If the pfDispList
       is a <B>PFDL_RING</B>, <B>pfDrawDList</B> will continually draw the dis-
       executes libpr state routines that in turn execute graph-
       ics library commands that send command tokens down the
       graphics pipeline.  <B>pfDrawDList</B> is itself a display-
       listable command provided <I>dlist</I> is not the currently
       active pfDispList.  The return value is the end of frame,
       <B>PFDL_END_OF_FRAME</B>, forced return <B>PFDL_RETURN</B>, or end of
       list <B>PFDL_END_OF_LIST</B> token will be returned or else -1 if
       an error is encountered.  If the current pfDispList mode
       is <B>PFDL_MODE_COMPILE_GL</B>, the <B>PFDL_END_OF_LIST</B> token will
       be returned.

       <B>pfCompileDList</B> will compile a pfDispList into a GL display
       list. The return value is that from <B>pfDrawDList</B> and will
       be -1 if an error is encountered.  Note that user callback
       functions in pfDispLists are only exectued upon display
       list creation.

       <B>pfDListMode</B> sets the specified <I>mode</I> to the given value.
       The supported mode is <B>PFDL_MODE_COMPILE_GL</B> and when set to
       1, this causes the associated GL display list to be drawn
       when <B>pfDrawDList</B> is called and a new GL display list will
       be auto-created if one does not exist or of the current
       display list is dirty. By default, <B>PFDL_MODE_COMPILE_GL</B> is
       false.  User callback functions in pfDispLists are only
       exectued upon display list creation.  <B>pfGetDListMode</B>
       returns the current value of <I>mode</I>.

       The following example draws a pfGeoSet into a pfDispList
       and then subsequently draws the pfDispList:

       /* Open DList and append GSet */
       pfOpenDList(dlist);
       pfEnable(PFEN_WIREFRAME);
       pfDrawGSet(gset);

       /* Close DList and return to immediate mode */
       pfCloseDList();

       /* Draw 'gset' in wireframe */
       pfDrawDList(dlist);


       <B>pfDListCallback</B> allows custom rendering in the middle of a
       display list by putting a function callback and data in
       the current display list.  Up to 64 bytes of user-data may
       be copied into the display list.  <I>nbytes</I> specifies the
       length of data that <I>data</I> references.  When a callback
       token is encountered while drawing a display list, the
       function <I>callback</I> will be called with a pointer to the
       user data that is cached in the display list.  A callback
       may call <B>pfPushState</B> upon entering and <B>pfPopState</B> when
       leaving to ensure that any state changes made in the call-
       back will be not inherited by subsequent geometry.

       <B>pfAddDListCmd</B> adds <I>cmd</I> to the currently active display
       list.  <I>cmd</I> is one of the following symbolic tokens, both
       of which return control to the application but indicate
       different situations.
              <B>PFDL_RETURN</B>

       OpenGL Performer optimizes pfDispList's when they are
       being built by eliminating redundant mode changes and by
       unwinding pfGeoStates into their component parts.  As a
       result, modifications to objects after they are placed in
       a pfDispList may be ignored by the pfDispList.  To be
       safe, do not modify any objects that were placed in one or
       more pfDispLists.

       Here is an example of this phenomenon:

       /* Attach gstate0 to gset */
       pfGSetGState(gset, gstate0);

       /* Open dlist as current pfDispList */
       pfOpenDList(dlist);
       pfDrawGSet(gset);

       /* Return to immediate mode */
       pfCloseDList();

       /* Attach gstate1 to gset */
       pfGSetGState(gset, gstate1);

       /*
        * dlist will use gstate0 and not be aware that gset was modified to
        * use gstate1.
        */
       pfDrawDList(dlist);



   <B>Preprocessing</B> <B>a</B> <B>Display</B> <B>List</B>
       The following routines are useful in <B>libpr</B>-only applica-
       tions; <B>libpf</B> applications do not need to call these rou-
       tines.  Preprocessing of the light point display list is
       automatically managed by the <B>libpf</B> Light Point process
       (see <B>pfConfig</B>).

       <B>pfPreprocessDList</B> is used to preprocess  the <I>dlist</I> display
       list in order to accelerate it's handling in the draw pro-
       cess.  This call must be encapsulated between the open and
       close of another pfDispList.  It is just like drawing a
       pfDispList into another one.

       The <I>flag</I> is a bit field that indicates which preprocessing
       is to be done. Currently only <B>PFDL_PREPROCESS_LPSTATE</B>
       (which computes the appearance of each light point) is
       defined. See <B>pfLPointState</B> and <B>pfCalligraphic</B> for further
       information.

       Preprocessing makes sense only if it is done in a separate
       process, so that these computations can be done while the
       Draw Process is drawing other display lists. Typically,
       the Draw Process will draw the polygons of the scene while
       the Preprocessing process is performing the light point
       computations. This is what the Light Point Process does in
       libpf.


       /* set the performer View Matrix */
       /* used to compute the intensity of each light */
       pfViewMat(viewMat);
       /* can be obtain from pfInvertOrthoNMatMat.invertOrthoN(viewMat,invViewMat); */
       /* and also not mandatory. Will be computed from viewMat if not given */
       /* used to do the 3D-&gt;2D projection for the calligraphics lights points */
       pfInvViewMat(invViewMat);
       pfNearPixDist(nearPixDist);
       /* can use getGLProjMat from a Frustum to get this matrix */
       pfProjMat(projMat);
       /* Open the Draw RING Display List */
       pfOpenDList(lpointDrawDList);
       /* preprocess the LPoint FLAT Display List */
       pfPreprocessDList(lpointPreprocessDList,PFDL_PREPROCESS_LPSTATE);
       /* Post an end of frame token in the ring Dlist */
       pfAddDListCmd(PFDL_END_OF_FRAME);
       /* Close the Draw RING Display List */
       pfCloseDList();


       Note that pfSelectCalligraphic, pfViewMat, pfInvViewMat,
       pfNearPixDist and pfProjMat are all Display List-able, and
       should not go in the lpointDrawDList, as they are needed
       to configure the preprocessing.

       Also, processing of pfLPointState requires that the
       <B>pfModelMat()</B> matrix are stored in the lpointPreprocess-
       DList each time the model matrix changes before drawing a
       pfGeoSet. This is done automatically by the Culler in a
       <B>libpf</B> application.

       So, the Draw Process simply looks like this:

       /* do usual Channel settings */
       /* including pfPixScale if using DVR */
       pfPixScale(scale);
       /* draw the polygons */
       pfDrawDList(polygonDList);
       /* draw the light point Draw Ring DLIST */
       pfDrawDList(lpointDrawDList);
       /* will exit at the EndOfFrame token */
       /* whatever */
       /* then swapbuffer */


       Note that in the case of calligraphic light points it is
       mandatory that the lpoints are the last geometric elements
       sent to the graphic pipe.
