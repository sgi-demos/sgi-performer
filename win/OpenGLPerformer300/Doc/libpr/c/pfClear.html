pfClear(3pf)                                         pfClear(3pf)




</PRE>
<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       <B>pfClear</B> - Clear specified graphics buffers


</PRE>
<H2>FUNCTION SPECIFICATION</H2><PRE>
       void   <B>pfClear</B>(int which, const pfVec4 color);


</PRE>
<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       <I>which</I>  is  a  mask  that specifies which buffers are to be
              cleared.  <I>which</I> is a bitwise OR of:

              <B>PFCL_COLOR</B>          Clear color buffer to <I>color</I>.

              <B>PFCL_DEPTH</B>          Clear depth buffer  to  maximum
                                  value   of  our  defined  depth
                                  range.

              <B>PFCL_MSDEPTH</B>        Fast clear of  the  multisample
                                  depth buffer.

              <B>PFCL_STENCIL</B>        Clear stencil buffer to 0.

              <B>PFCL_DITHER</B>         Enable   dithering  during  the
                                  color   clear.    By   default,
                                  <B>pfClear</B> turns off dithering for
                                  color clears.

       <I>color</I>  specifies the red, green, blue,  and  alpha  compo-
              nents of the color buffer clear color.  Each compo-
              nent is defined in the range 0.0 to 1.0.  If  <I>color</I>
              is  NULL  then  a  black fully opaque color will be
              used.


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>pfClear</B> clears the buffers specified by <I>which</I> in the  cur-
       rent  graphics  window.   The  actual  screen area cleared
       depends on many GL state settings including  viewport  and
       screen  or  scissor  mask (OpenGL <B>glScissor</B>), current draw
       buffer (front, back, left, right, overlay, etc.), and  the
       existence  of  a  depth  buffer for <B>PFCL_DEPTH</B> and stencil
       buffer for <B>PFCL_STENCIL</B>.  See the OpenGL <B>glClear(3g)</B>  ref-
       erence page for more details.

       If  <I>which</I>  includes <B>PFCL_COLOR</B> and <I>color</I> is NULL, then any
       selected color buffer  will  be  cleared  to  black  fully
       opaque pixels using <B>glColor4f(0,0,0,1)</B> in OpenGL.

       <B>PFCL_MSDEPTH</B>  has  effect  only  when  multisampling  (See
       <B>pfAntialias</B>).  In this case, instead of writing the  maxi-
       mum depth value into each individual pixel subsample, each
       pixel is "tagged" as having the maximum depth value.  This
       clear  is much faster than a full depth buffer clear; how-
       ever, the color buffer is not cleared so results from pre-
       vious  frames  will  be  left  in  the color buffer if not
       redrawn.  This requires that each pixel in the viewport be
       covered  by geometry.  Often this is accomplished by draw-
       depth  buffer  clear  will be required if multisampling is
       not in use or not supported  in  the  current  framebuffer
       configuration.   Note  that  the background drawing should
       leave depth buffering enabled so that  it's  depth  values
       will be written.

       The follow example shows how to clear all buffers with one
       <B>pfClear</B> call:

       /*
        * Clear color buffer to black, depth buffer to the maximum depth value,
        * and stencil buffer to 0.
        */
       pfClear(PFCL_DEPTH | PFCL_COLOR | PFCL_STENCIL, NULL);


       <B>pfClear</B> is a display-listable command.  If a pfDispList
       has been opened by <B>pfOpenDList</B>, <B>pfClear</B> will not have
       immediate effect but will be captured by the pfDispList
       and will only have effect when that pfDispList is later
       drawn with <B>pfDrawDList</B>.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       <B>PFCL_MSDEPTH</B> is only available on RealityEngine systems,
       and then only in the multisample antialiasing mode.  For
       performance reasons, the depth buffer for the entire win-
       dow rather than just the current viewport is cleared with
       OpenGL on Indy, i.e. scissoring is disabled.
