<H2>PARENT CLASS FUNCTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The  OpenGL  Performer  class  <B>pfStats</B> is derived from the
       parent class <B>pfObject</B>, so each of these  member  functions
       of class <B>pfObject</B> are also directly usable with objects of
       class <B>pfStats</B>.  This is also true for ancestor classes  of
       class <B>pfObject</B>.

       void*   <B>pfObject::operator</B> <B>new</B>(size_t);
       void*   <B>pfObject::operator</B> <B>new</B>(size_t, void *arena);
       void*   <B>pfObject::operator</B>      <B>new</B>(size_t,     pfFluxMem-
                 ory *fmem);
       void    <B>pfObject::setUserData</B>(void *data);
       void    <B>pfObject::setUserData</B>(int slot, void *data);
       void*   <B>pfObject::getUserData</B>(pfObject *obj);
       void*   <B>pfObject::getUserData</B>(pfObject *obj, int slot);
       int     <B>pfObject::getNumUserData</B>();


       Since the class <B>pfObject</B> is itself derived from the parent
       class  <B>pfMemory</B>, objects of class <B>pfStats</B> can also be used
       with  these  functions  designed  for  objects  of   class
       <B>pfMemory</B>.

       void*          <B>pfMemory::getData</B>(const void *ptr);
       pfType *       <B>pfMemory::getType</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::isOfType</B>(pfType *type);
       int            <B>pfMemory::isExactType</B>(pfType *type);
       const char *   <B>pfMemory::getTypeName</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::copy</B>(pfMemory *src);
       int            <B>pfMemory::compare</B>(const pfMemory *mem);

                        char *prefix, FILE *file);
       int            <B>pfMemory::getArena</B>(void *ptr);

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       These functions are used to  collect,  manipulate,  print,
       and  query  statistics  on state operations, geometry, and
       graphics and system operations.


       <B>pfStats::getClassType</B> returns the <B>pfType</B>*  for  the  class
       <B>pfStats</B>.  The <B>pfType</B>* returned by <B>pfStats::getClassType</B> is
       the same as the <B>pfType</B>* returned by invoking  the  virtual
       function   <B>getType</B>  on  any  instance  of  class  <B>pfStats</B>.
       Because OpenGL Performer allows  subclassing  of  built-in
       types,  when  decisions  are  made based on the type of an
       object, it is usually better to use  the  member  function
       <B>isOfType</B>  to test if an object is of a type derived from a
       Performer type rather than to test for strict equality  of
       the <B>pfType</B>*'s.

       <B>pfStats::reset</B> will reset that entire statistics structure
       to its initial state.

       <B>pfStats::clear</B>  takes  a  bitmask  <I>which</I>  specifying   the
       statistics that are to be cleared to zeroes.

       <B>pfStats::copy</B>  takes  a  pointer  to a pfStats, <I>src</I>, and a
       bitmask <I>which</I> specifying the statistics  that  are  to  be
       copied from <I>src</I>.  This function is provided to enable more
       control over the default pfObject function <B>pfMemory::copy</B>.
       Note  that  only  statistics  data  is  copied and not any
       enable/disable settings or modes.

       Since some statistics can be expensive to gather,  and  so
       might  possibly influence other statistics, statistics are
       divided into different classes based  on  the  tasks  that
       they  monitor  and  one may select the specific statistics
       classes of interest with <B>pfStats::setClass</B>.

       Statistics classes also have different modes of collection
       so   that  performance-expensive  modes  of  a  particular
       statistics     class     many     be     disabled     with
       <B>pfStats::setClassMode</B>.   The  statistics class enables may
       be used for directing operations on statistics structures,
       including    statistics    collection,    specified    via
       <B>pfStats::open</B>, and also for printing,  copying,  clearing,
       accumulation, and averaging.

       Class  enables  and  disables are specified with bitmasks.
       Each statistics class has an enable token:  a  <B>PFSTATS_EN*</B>
       token  that  can  be  OR-ed  with  other statistics enable
       tokens and the result passed  in  to  enable  and  disable
       statistics operations.

       Statistics  classes  that require special hardware support
       have token names that start with <B>PFSTATSHW_</B>.  These tokens
       are  used  as  class enable tokens in the usual statistics
       routines, and also to  enable  and  disable  the  hardware
       statistics    gathering    via    <B>pfStats::enableHw</B>    and
       <B>pfStats::disableHw</B>.

       Statistics classes also have modes that  select  different
       elements  of  a class for collection.  These modes are set
       through  <B>pfStats::setClassMode</B>.   Each  statistics   class
       starts with a default mode setting.

       The  following  tables  provide  details of the statistics
       <B>PFSTATSHW_GFXPIPE_FILL</B>$<B>PFSTATSHW_ENGFXPIPE_FILL</B>      CPU$-

       The  individual  stats  classes and modes are discussed in
       more detail in the explanation of the statistics routines.

       <B>pfStats::setClass</B>  will  set  the classes specified in the
       bitmask, <I>enmask</I>, according to the <I>val</I>, which must  be  set
       to one of the following:

              <B>PFSTATS_ON</B>               Enables    the   specified
                                       classes.

              <B>PFSTATS_OFF</B>              Disables   the   specified
                                       classes.

              <B>PFSTATS_DEFAULT</B>          Resets    the    specified
                                       classes to default values.

              <B>PFSTATS_SET</B>              Sets   the   entire  class
                                       enable mask to <I>enmask</I>.

       All stats collection can be set at once to on, off, or the
       default  by  using  <B>PFSTATS_ALL</B>  for  the  bitmask and the
       appropriate value for the enable flag.  For  example,  the
       following  example  disables  all stats classes with their
       current class mode settings.

       stats.setClass(<B>PFSTATS_ALL</B>, <B>PFSTATS_OFF</B>);


       <B>pfStats::getClass</B> takes the statistics classes of interest
       specified in the bitmask, <I>enmask</I>.  If any of the statis-
       tics classes specified in <I>enmask</I> are enabled, then
       <B>pfStats::getClass</B> will return the bitmask of those
       classes, and otherwise, will return zero.  If classes of
       an open pfStats structure are disabled, then collection of
       those classes stop immediately and those classes are con-
       enabled by default.  Some modes of a statistics class may
       be somewhat expensive, and therefore they are not enabled
       by default.  <I>val</I> must be one of:

              <B>PFSTATS_ON</B>               Enable the modes specified
                                       in <I>mask</I>.

              <B>PFSTATS_OFF</B>              Disable the modes speci-
                                       fied in <I>mask</I>.

              <B>PFSTATS_DEFAULT</B>          Set modes specified in
                                       <I>mask</I> to default values.

              <B>PFSTATS_SET</B>              Set class mode mask to the
                                       specified <I>mask</I>.

       As a convenience, all classes may have all of their modes
       set to on, off, or their default values by specifying a
       <I>class</I> of <B>PFSTATS_CLASSES</B>, and a mask of <B>PFSTATS_ALL</B>.
       These defaults may differ between machines and may change
       in the future; so, code should not assume the current
       defaults but query the mode values for a given class where
       needed.  No statistics for a given mode are accumulated
       unless the corresponding class has been enabled with
       <B>pfStats::setClass</B>.  If modes of an open pfStats structure
       are disabled, then collection of those modes stop immedi-
       ately.

       <B>Graphics</B> <B>Statistics</B> <B>Modes</B>

              <B>PFSTATS_GFX_GEOM</B>
                   This counts geometry that is drawn via
                   <B>pfGeoSet::draw</B>.  Statistics include the number
                   of pfGeoSets drawn, and the numbers of
                   pfGeoSets that have each binding of each
                   attribute, colors, normals, texture coordi-
                   nates.  The number of each type of pfGeoSet
                   primitive is counted, as well as the number of
                   base primitives drawn: total triangles, lines,
                   and points.  Statistics are also kept on the
                   number of triangle strips drawn and the number
                   of the total triangles that were actually in a
                   triangle strip.  This mode is enabled by
                   default.

              <B>PFSTATS_GFX_TSTRIP_LENGTHS</B>
                   The number of triangles in strips whose length
                   in terms of triangle count is shorter than
                   <B>PFSTATS_TSTRIP_LENGTHS_MAX</B> is recorded.  Tri-
                   angles in strips whose triangle count is
                   greater than or equal to
                   <B>PFSTATS_TSTRIP_LENGTHS_MAX</B> are all counted
                   together.  Quads are counted as strips of
                   length two and independent triangles are
                   counted as strips of length one.  An average
                   triangle strip length (that uses all of the
                   actual lengths) is also maintained.  Keeping
                   these triangle strip statistics is expensive
                   for the drawing operation and so this mode is
                   Keeping attribute statistics is expensive for
                   the drawing operation and so this mode is not
                   enabled by default, but must be enabled with
                   <B>pfStats::setClassMode</B>.

              <B>PFSTATS_GFX_STATE</B>
                   This mode enables the counting of calls to
                   state changes, as well as the number of actual
                   state changes themselves.  Such state changes
                   include the immediate mode routines such as
                   <B>pfAntialias</B>, and the application of the state
                   structures, such as <B>pfTexture::apply</B>.  Also
                   counted is the number of pfGeoStates encoun-
                   tered and the number of state stack opera-
                   tions, such as <B>pfGeoState::load</B>,
                   <B>pfGeoState::apply</B>, <B>pfPushState</B>, and
                   <B>pfPopState</B>.  This mode is enabled by default.

              <B>PFSTATS_GFX_XFORM</B>
                   This mode enables the counting of calls to
                   transformations, such as <B>pfTranslate</B>, <B>pfScale</B>,
                   and <B>pfRotate</B>, and graphics matrix stack opera-
                   tions, such as <B>pfLoadMatrix</B>, etc.  the number
                   of actual state changes themselves, as well as
                   the number of pfGeoStates encountered.  This
                   mode is enabled by default.

              <B>PFSTATS_GFX_CULL_SIDEKICK</B>
                   This mode enables counting OpenGL primitives
                   removed by a CULL_SIDEKICK process.

       <B>Graphics</B> <B>Pipe</B> <B>Fill</B> <B>Statistics</B>

       These modes enable the accumulation of fill depth-complex-
       ity statistics and require the corresponding hardware
       statistics to be enabled:

       pfStats::enableHw(<B>PFSTATSHW_GFXPIPE_FILL_DEPTHCMP</B>);


              <B>PFSTATSHW_GFXPIPE_FILL_DCPAINT</B>
                   This mode causes <B>pfStats::close</B> to paint the
                   screen according to the number of times each
                   pixel is touched.  This mode is enabled by
                   default.

              <B>PFSTATSHW_GFXPIPE_FILL_DCCOUNT</B>
                   This  mode causes <B>pfStats::close</B> to read back
                   the framebuffer for the calculation of fill
                   depth-complexity statistics.  This mode is
                   enabled by default.

              <B>PFSTATSHW_GFXPIPE_FILL_DEPTHCMP</B>
                   By default, only actual pixel writes are
                   counted with depth complexity stats.  This
                   mode enables counting of Z compares as well.
                   This mode is not enabled by default.

              <B>PFSTATSHW_GFXPIPE_FILL_TRANSP</B>

       that the corresponding hardware statistics be enabled:

       pfStats::enableHw(<B>PFSTATSHW_ENCPU</B>);

       The percentage of time CPUs spend idle, busy, in user
       code, and waiting on the Graphics Pipeline, or on the
       swapping of memory is calculated.  Counted is the number
       of context switches (process and graphics), the number of
       system calls, the number of times the graphics FIFO is
       found to be full, the number of times a CPU went to sleep
       waiting on a full graphics FIFO, the number of graphics
       pipeline IOCTLs issued (by the system), and the number of
       swapbuffers seen.  All of these statistics are computed
       over an elapsed period of time, and using an elapsed
       interval of at least one second is recommended.

              <B>PFSTATSHW_CPU_SYS</B>
                   This mode enables computation of the above CPU
                   statistics for the entire system.  This
                   includes statistics on system usage, cpu-
                   graphics interactions, and memory.  CPU usage
                   statistics are summed over all CPUs.  This
                   mode is enabled by default.

              <B>PFSTATSHW_CPU_IND</B>
                   This mode enables tracking of CPU statistics
                   for each individual CPU and is much more
                   expensive than using just the summed statis-
                   tics.  It is not enabled by default.

       <B>pfStats::getClassMode</B> takes the name of the class to
       query,  <I>class</I>.  The return value is the mode of <I>class</I>.

       <B>pfStats::open</B> takes a bitmask specifying the statistics
       classes that are to be opened for collection in <I>enmask</I>.
       This statistics structure will become the one and only
       statistics structure open for collection.  The return
       value will be the bitmask for all currently open statis-
       tics classes.  If another pfStats structure is already
       open, then this call to <B>pfStats::open</B> will be ignored and
       the return value will be 0.  When statistics classes that
       use statistics hardware are open for collection,
       <B>pfStats::open</B> will access that hardware for initializa-
       tion.  Therefore, for graphics pipe statistics, it is
       imperative that the statistics hardware only be enabled
       for the drawing process.  Furthermore, only one process at
       a time should use statistics hardware since it is a shared
       global resource.  Finally, for statistics that are actu-
       ally accumulated in statistics hardware, it is best to let
       some time elapse before the statistics are collected (in
       <B>pfStats::close</B>).  Refer the examples at the end of this
       manual page.

       <B>pfStats::close</B> takes a bitmask <I>which</I> specifying the
       classes whose collected statistics are to be accumulated
       into the current <B>pfStats</B> structure.  Further collection of
       these statistics are then disabled and they will have to
       be re-opened with <B>pfStats::open</B> for further collection.  A
       pfStats structure is considered to be open until all
       graphics pipe statistics, it is imperative that the
       statistics hardware only be enabled for the drawing pro-
       cess.  Furthermore, only one processes should be using
       statistics hardware at a time since it is a shared global
       resource.

       <B>pfStats::getOpen</B> takes a bitmask <I>enmask</I> specifying the
       statistics classes that are being queried.  If any of the
       statistics classes specified in <I>enmask</I> are open for col-
       lection, then the bitmask of those statistics classes is
       returned, and otherwise, zero.

       <B>pfGetCurStats</B> returns the currently open statistics struc-
       ture, or NULL if there is no statistics structure open for
       accumulation.

       <B>pfGfxPipeTimestamp</B> allows the specification of a
       <B>PFSTATSHW_TIMETAMP_</B> token for the currently open pfStats
       structure with <B>PFSTATSHW_GFXPIPE_TIMES</B> enabled. These
       tokens may be one of the following and must be issued once
       per collection period and in increasing order.

              <B>PFSTATSHW_TIMESTAMP_START</B>
                   signal start of drawing.

              <B>PFSTATSHW_TIMESTAMP_END</B>
                   signal end of drawing.

              <B>PFSTATSHW_TIMESTAMP_FRAME_END</B>
                   signals end of frame and is automatically fol-
                   lowed by a <B>PFSTATSHW_TIMESTAMP_FINISH</B> to flush
                   graphics pipeline.

              <B>PFSTATSHW_TIMESTAMP_FINISH</B>
                   will flush the graphics pipeline to ensure
                   that all drawing is including in the timing.
       The <B>PFSTATSHW_TIMESTAMP_OPEN</B> and <B>PFSTATSHW_TIMESTAMP_CLOSE</B>
       may be issued only by OpenGL Performer and these are
       issued automatically when <B>PFSTATSHW_GFXPIPE_TIMES</B> statis-
       tics are opened and closed.

       <B>pfGetStatsGfxPipeTimestampStatus</B> may be used to find out
       if a given timestamp for the specified pfStats structure
       has completed its trip through the graphics pipeline (and
       has resulting data ready for collection).

       <B>pfCollectGfxPipeStatspfStats::collectGfxPipe</B>  may be used
       to collect graphics pipeline statistics for a structure
       after the statistics for that structure have been closed.
       Graphics pipeline statistics must be gathered in the same
       order that the timestamps are issued.  If separate collec-
       tion of graphics pipeline statistics are to be done, the
       <B>pfStats::setClassMode</B> of
       <B>PFSTATSHW_GFXPIPE_TIMES_AUTO_COLLECT</B> (which is on by
       default) must be turned off.

       <B>pfStats::setAttr</B> takes the name of the attribute to set,
       <I>attr</I>, and the attribute value, <I>val</I>.  Currently, there are
       no pfStats attributes.  <B>pfStats::getAttr</B> takes a pointer
       start with <B>PFSTATSHW_*</B>.  Statistics hardware must be
       enabled for the corresponding classes of statistics to be
       accumulated.  Having statistics hardware enabled will have
       some cost to performance; however, in most cases, it pays
       to leave this hardware enabled if corresponding statistics
       classes are being frequently enabled and disabled.  When
       statistics classes that use statistics hardware are open
       for collection, <B>pfStats::open</B> and <B>pfStats::close</B> will
       access that hardware.  For graphics pipe statistics, it is
       therefore imperative that the statistics hardware only be
       enabled for a process that is connected to the graphics
       pipeline.  Furthermore, only one processes should be using
       statistics hardware at a time since it is a shared global
       resource.

       <B>Graphics</B> <B>Statistics</B> <B>Hardware</B> <B>Enables</B>

              <B>PFSTATSHW_ENGFXPIPE_TIMES</B>
                   Enables the tracking of timestamps in the
                   graphics pipeline.  This produces very accu-
                   rate measurements of elapsed drawing times
                   with minimal impact.  Timestamps are issued
                   automatically when statistics are opened and
                   closed, and additional stamps may be issued
                   with <B>pfGfxPipeTimestamp</B>.

              <B>PFSTATSHW_ENGFXPIPE_FILL</B>
                   Enables hardware to support tracking of depth
                   complexity statistics.  When this mode is
                   enabled, the framebuffer keeps track of the
                   number of times each pixel is touched.  This
                   may require a framebuffer reconfiguration
                   which can be quite expensive, and which may
                   not be possible in GLX windows.

              <B>PFSTATSHW_ENCPU</B>
                   This mode enable gathering of CPU statistics
                   by the system.  This mode should only be
                   enabled by one process at a time.

       <B>pfStats::disableHw</B> takes a bitmask <I>which</I> specifying the
       hardware statistics that should be disabled.

       <B>pfStats::getHwEnable</B> takes a bitmask <I>which</I> specifying the
       hardware statistics that are being queried.  If any of the
       hardware statistics classes specified in <I>which</I> have their
       corresponding hardware enabled, then the bitmask of those
       statistics classes is returned, and otherwise, zero is
       returned.

       <B>pfStats::setHwAttr</B> takes the name of the attribute to set,
       <I>attr</I>, and the attribute value, <I>val</I>.  There is currently
       one stats hardware attribute:  <B>PFSTATSHW_FILL_DCBITS</B>.  Its
       value must be an integer value in the range of 1 to 4.
       The default value is 3.  This attribute sets the maximum
       number of stencil bits used for tracking fill depth com-
       plexity.  See the GL manual page for <B>stensize(3g)</B> for more
       information on stencil bitplanes.


       <B>pfStats::query</B> takes a query token in <I>which</I>, and a desti-
       nation buffer <I>dst</I>.  The size of the expected return data
       is specified by <I>size</I> and if non-zero, will prevent
       <B>pfStats::query</B> from writing beyond a buffer that is too
       small.  The return value is the number of bytes written to
       the destination buffer.  There are tokens for getting back
       all of the statistics, entire sub-structures, and individ-
       ual values.  The exposed query structure types and query
       tokens are all defined in <I>&lt;Performer/pr/pfStats.h&gt;</I>.  Every
       structure and field is commented with its corresponding
       query token.  For example, the exposed structure type pfS-
       tatsValues can be used to hold the entire contents of a
       pfStats structure and has corresponding query token
       <B>PFSTATSVAL_ALL</B>.

       typedef struct pfStatsValues
       {   /* to get back all stats:       PFSTATSVAL_ALL                 */
           /* PFSTATS_GFX class:             PFSTATSVAL_GFX               */
           pfStatsValGeom      geom;        /* PFSTATSVAL_GFX_GEOM        */
           pfStatsValModes     modeChanges; /* PFSTATSVAL_GFX_MODECHANGES */
           pfStatsValModes     modeCalls;   /* PFSTATSVAL_GFX_MODECALLS   */
           pfStatsValState     state;       /* PFSTATSVAL_GFX_STATE       */
           pfStatsValXforms    xform;       /* PFSTATSVAL_GFX_XFORM       */
           /* PFSTATSHW_GFXPIPE_FILL class: PFSTATSVAL_GFXPIPE_FILL       */
           pfStatsValFill      fill;        /* PFSTATSVAL_GFXPIPE_FILL    */
           /* the PFSTATSHW_CPU class:      PFSTATSVAL_CPU                */
           pfStatsValCPU       cpu;         /* PFSTATSVAL_CPU             */
       } pfStatsValues;


       The following example will return all of the contents of a
       pfStats structure into the contents of a structure of the
       exposed type pfStatsValues.

       pfStats *stats;
       pfStatsValues *val;

       stats = new pfStats;
       stats-&gt;query(<B>PFSTATSVAL_ALL</B>, (float *) val, sizeof(pfStatsValues));

       <B>pfStats::mQuery</B> takes a pointer to the start of an array
       of query tokens in <I>which</I>, and a destination buffer <I>dst</I>.
       The array <I>which</I> must be terminated with the token PFS-
       TATSVAL_NULL.  The size of the expected return data is
       specified by <I>size</I> and if non-zero, will prevent
       <B>pfStats::mQuery</B> from writing beyond a buffer that is too
       small.  The return value is the number of bytes written to
       the destination buffer.

       <B>pfStats::count</B> takes a pointer to a pfGeoSet, <I>gset</I>, whose
       geometry statistics are to be accumulated into <I>stats</I>.

       <B>pfStats::accumulate</B> takes a pointer to a statistics struc-
       ture, <I>src</I>, and a bitmask <I>which</I> specifying the statistics
       that are to be accumulated from <I>src</I>.

       <B>pfStats::average</B> takes a pointer to a statistics struc-
       ture, <I>src</I>, and a bitmask <I>which</I>, and an integer <I>num</I>. The

              2.   The corresponding statistics class must be
                   enabled with <B>pfStats::setClass</B>.  No statistics
                   classes are enabled by default.

              3.   The corresponding statistics class mode must
                   be enabled with <B>pfStats::setClassMode</B>.  How-
                   ever, each statistics class has a popular set
                   of statistics modes enabled by default.

              4.   Any relevant hardware must be enabled via
                   <B>pfStats::enableHw</B>.

              5.   The statistics class must be opened for col-
                   lection with <B>pfStats::open</B>.

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>
       This example creates a statistics structure and enabling
       the graphics statistics class with the triangle-strip
       statistics enabled.

       pfStats *stats = NULL;
       stats = new pfStats;
       stats-&gt;setClass(PFSTATS_ENGFX, PFSTATS_ON);
       stats-&gt;setClassMode(PFSTATS_GFX, PFSTATS_GFX_TSTRIP_LENGTHS, PFSTATS_ON);


       This is an example of collecting CPU statistics over an
       elapsed period of time.

       pfStats *stats = NULL;
       double lastTime = 0;
       stats = new pfStats;

       /* enable the CPU stats class - using the default summed CPU statistics */
       stats-&gt;setClass(PFSTATSHW, PFSTATS_ON);

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Fill stats are currently calculated by using stencil tests
       and therefore require stencil bitplanes to be allocated.
       Furthermore, the <B>PFSTATSHW_GFXPIPE_FILL_TRANSP</B> mode cur-
       rently disables modes that reject fully transparent pix-
       els, such as <B>pfAlphaFunc</B>, which will alter what pixels get
       written into the zbuffer and therefore should be used in
       conjunction with <B>PFSTATSHW_GFXPIPE_FILL_DEPTHCMP</B>.

       The pfStats routines, structures, and constants are
       defined in the &lt;Performer/prstats.h&gt; header file.
