<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       OpenGL Performer manages a subset of the graphics  library
       state  for  convenience and improved performance. Further,
       this state is conceptually partitioned into two divisions:
       modes  and  attributes.  A mode is a simple "setting" usu-
       ally represented by a single value while an attribute is a
       larger collection of related modes that is encapsulated in
       an OpenGL Performer structure, such as <B>pfFog</B>.

       Modes usually have two routines to set and get them  while
       attributes  have many routines for accessing their parame-
       ters  and  a  <B>pf&lt;*&gt;::apply</B>  routine  which  "applies"  the
       attribute's  characteristics  to  the  graphics system via
       graphics library state commands.  Modes are represented by
       basic  data  types like 'int' and 'float' while attributes
       are pointers to opaque OpenGL Performer  structures  whose
       contents are accessible only through function calls.

       An  example  of  a  mode  is  the  shading  model  set  by
       <B>pfShadeModel</B> and an attribute is exemplified by a  pfMate-
       rial  which  is applied with <B>pfMaterial::apply</B>.  Each mode
       and attribute is identified by a  <B>PFSTATE_</B>  token.   These
       tokens     are    used    in    <B>pfGeoState::setMode</B>    and
       <B>pfGeoState::setAttr</B> when initializing a pfGeoState and  in
       <B>pfOverride</B> to override mode and attribute settings.














       The  following  table  lists the state components that are
       modes.

       State values may be established within  libpr  in  one  of
       three ways:

              1.   Immediate mode

              2.   Display list mode

              3.   pfGeoState mode

       Like the graphics library itself, OpenGL Performer has two
       command execution modes: immediate mode and  display  list
       mode.   In  immediate  mode,  the setting of a mode or the
       application of an attribute is  carried  out  immediately.
       Any  geometry  rendered afterwards will be drawn with that
       mode or attribute characteristics.  In display list  mode,
       the  command  will  be "captured" by the open display list
       (pfDispList) and will not have effect  until  the  display
       list is closed and later drawn with <B>pfDispList::draw</B>.

       All  the  routines listed in Table 1 are display-listable,
       pfState  must  have been selected by <B>pfState::select</B>. Note
       that neither a graphics context nor  pfState  is  required
       when  drawing  in  display  list mode because the commands
       will be captured by the display list.

       Example 1:

       /* Enable wireframe in immediate mode */
       pfEnable(PFEN_WIREFRAME);

       /* Draw 'gset' in wireframe */
       gset-&gt;draw();


       Example 2:

       /* Enter display list mode by opening 'dlist' for appending */
       dlist-&gt;open();
       pfEnable(PFEN_WIREFRAME);
       gset-&gt;draw();
       pfDispList::close();

       /* Draw 'gset' in wireframe */
       dlist-&gt;draw();


       It is important to realize that OpenGL Performer display
       lists (pfDispLists) are different from graphics library
       display lists.  A pfDispList captures only <B>libpr</B> commands
       and does not contain low-level geometric information like
       vertex coordinates and colors.

       The pfGeoState encapsulates all of libpr state, i.e. it
       has all mode settings and a pointer to a definition for
       each attribute type.  Through <B>pfGeoState::setMode</B> and
       <B>pfGeoState::setAttr</B> it is possible to set every state ele-
       ment of a pfGeoState.  When the pfGeoState is applied
       through <B>pfGeoState::apply</B> all the state settings encapsu-
       lated by the pfGeoState become active.  pfGeoStates also
       have useful inheritance properties that are discussed in
       the pfGeoState man page.  Typical use of a pfGeoState is
       to "build" it at database initialization time and attach
       it to a pfGeoSet (<B>pfGeoSet::setGState</B>).  In this way the
       pfGeoState defines the graphics state of the geometry
       encapsulated by the pfGeoSet (pfDrawGSet will call
       <B>pfGeoState::apply</B> if the pfGeoSet has an attached
       pfGeoState).

       Example 3:

       /* Set up wireframe pfGeoState */
       gstate = new pfGeoState;
       gstate-&gt;setMode(PFSTATE_ENWIREFRAME, PF_ON);

       /* Draw wireframe pfGeoSet in "pfGeoState" mode */
       gstate-&gt;apply();          /* Apply 'gstate' */
       gset-&gt;draw();               /* Draw 'gset' in wireframe */

       /* Preferred method for drawing wireframe pfGeoSet */
       single process operation.  For proper multiprocess opera-
       tion, <B>pfInitState</B> should be called by a single process
       before calls to <B>sproc</B> or <B>fork</B> that will generate other
       processes using OpenGL Performer state, with an arena
       which is shared by all application processes.  In either
       single or multi-process operation, <B>pfInitState</B> must be
       called before any state attributes such as pfTextures are
       created and should only be called once.

       <B>new</B>(arena) allocates a pfState from the specified memory
       arena, or from the process heap if <I>arena</I> is NULL.  <B>new</B>
       allocates a pfState from the default memory arena (see
       <B>pfGetSharedArena</B>).  Like other pfObjects, pfStates cannot
       be created statically, automatically on the stack or in
       arrays.  pfStates should be deleted with <B>pfDelete</B> rather
       than the delete operator.  Specifically, a pfState has a
       stack of state structures that shadow OpenGL Performer and
       graphics library state.  This stack may be manipulated by
       routines described below.

       <B>pfState::getClassType</B> returns the <B>pfType</B>* for the class
       <B>pfState</B>.  The <B>pfType</B>* returned by <B>pfState::getClassType</B> is
       the same as the <B>pfType</B>* returned by invoking the virtual
       function <B>getType</B> on any instance of class <B>pfState</B>.
       Because OpenGL Performer allows subclassing of built-in
       types, when decisions are made based on the type of an
       object, it is usually better to use  the member function
       <B>isOfType</B> to test if an object is of a type derived from a
       Performer type rather than to test for strict equality of
       the <B>pfType</B>*'s.

       A pfState should be created for each graphics context that
       the process draws to with libpr routines.  When a process
       switches graphics contexts it should also switch to the
       corresponding pfState with <B>pfState::select</B>.

       <B>pfState::select</B> makes the pfState the current state.  pfS-
       tate is a global value so it is shared by all share group
       processes(See <B>sproc</B>).  <B>pfState::select</B> should be used when
       switching between different graphics contexts.  It does
       not configure the graphics context with its state set-
       tings.  <B>pfGetCurState</B> returns a pointer to the current
       pfState or NULL if there is no active pfState.

       Each pfState structure maintains a 64-deep stack of
       pfGeoStates.  A pfGeoState shadows all libpr modes and
       attributes.  Changes to the current state made through any
       of the 3 methods listed above are recorded in the top of
       the pfGeoState stack.  <B>pfGetState</B> copies the top of the
       pfGeoState stack into <I>gstate</I>.

       <B>pfPushState</B> pushes the pfGeoState stack of the current
       pfState.  When pushed, the configuration of the current
       state is recorded so that when popped, that state will be
       restored, overwriting any state changes made between push
       and pop.  The bit vector which represents state elements
       that are overridden by <B>pfOverride</B> is also pushed.

       <B>pfPopState</B> compares the current pfGeoState with that of
       OpenGL Performer state management which may or may not be
       desired.

       <B>pfFlushState</B> is only useful for applications which use
       pfGeoStates.  pfGeoStates do not inherit state from each
       other so state is pushed and popped when drawing them.
       For performance, state is not actually popped unless a
       subsequent pfGeoState requires it.  This means that in-
       between pfGeoStates, the state may not be what the appli-
       cation expects.  <B>pfFlushState</B> will return the state to the
       global default.(See pfGeoState for more on state flush-
       ing).  <B>pfPushState</B> calls <B>pfFlushState</B>.

       <B>pfPixScale</B> sets <I>scale</I> as the value to be used in scaling
       point and line width specifications. Global control of
       this scale factor is important when Dynamic Video Resolu-
       tion is in use, since points and lines must be reduced in
       width as much as they are enlarged by the video output
       system in order that the displayed geometry have the des-
       ignated width in display-pixel units. <B>pfGetPixScale</B>
       returns the current pixel scale value.

       <B>pfBasicState</B> is a convenience routine for disabling all
       modes and is useful for drawing things like text which
       usually should not be lit or fogged.  Specifically,
       <B>pfBasicState</B> is equivalent to the following:

       /* return graphics pipeline to basic state */
       pfDisable(PFEN_FOG);
       pfDisable(PFEN_LIGHTING);
       pfDisable(PFEN_TEXTURE);
       pfDisable(PFEN_WIREFRAME);
       pfDisable(PFEN_COLORTABLE);
       pfDisable(PFEN_HIGHLIGHTING);
       pfDisable(PFEN_LPOINTSTATE);
       pfDisable(PFEN_TEXGEN);
       pfDisable(PFEN_TEXMAT);

       pfShadeModel(PFSM_GOURAUD);
       pfAlphaFunc(0, PFAF_OFF);
       pfCullFace(PFCF_OFF);
       pfTransparency(PFTR_OFF);

       if (multisampling-type antialiasing is not enabled)
           pfAntialias(PFAA_OFF);

       pfDecal(PFDECAL_OFF);


       Use <B>pfGeoState::makeBasic</B> to configure every state element
       (value, mode, and attribute) of the pfGeoState to be iden-
       tical to the state set with <B>pfBasicState</B>.  The following
       code fragment is equivalent to <B>pfBasicState</B>:


       pfGeoState *gstate = new(NULL) pfGeoState();
       gstate-&gt;makeBasic();
       gstate-&gt;load();

       pfDecal, pfDelete, pfEnable, pfFog, pfGeoSet, pfGeoState,
       pfHighlight, pfLight, pfLightModel, pfLPointState, pfMate-
       rial, pfOverride, pfShadeModel, pfTexEnv, pfTexGen, pfTex-
       ture, pfTransparency
