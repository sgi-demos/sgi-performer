<H2>PARENT CLASS FUNCTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The OpenGL Performer class <B>pfDispList</B> is derived from the
       parent class <B>pfObject</B>, so each of these member functions
       of class <B>pfObject</B> are also directly usable with objects of
       class <B>pfDispList</B>.  This is also true for ancestor classes
       of class <B>pfObject</B>.
       void*   <B>pfObject::getUserData</B>(pfObject *obj);
       void*   <B>pfObject::getUserData</B>(pfObject *obj, int slot);
       int     <B>pfObject::getNumUserData</B>();


       Since the class <B>pfObject</B> is itself derived from the parent
       class <B>pfMemory</B>, objects of class <B>pfDispList</B> can also be
       used with these functions designed for objects of class
       <B>pfMemory</B>.

       void*          <B>pfMemory::getData</B>(const void *ptr);
       pfType *       <B>pfMemory::getType</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::isOfType</B>(pfType *type);
       int            <B>pfMemory::isExactType</B>(pfType *type);
       const char *   <B>pfMemory::getTypeName</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::copy</B>(pfMemory *src);

                        char *prefix, FILE *file);
       int            <B>pfMemory::getArena</B>(void *ptr);

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A pfDispList is a reusable display list that captures cer-
       tain libpr commands.  <B>new</B>(arena) allocates a pfDispList
       from the specified memory arena, or from the process heap
       if <I>arena</I> is NULL.  <B>new</B> allocates a pfDispList from the
       default memory arena (see <B>pfGetSharedArena</B>).  Like other
       pfObjects, pfDispLists cannot be created statically, auto-
       matically on the stack or in arrays.  The arguments to the
       constructor specify the type and size of the display list.
       pfDispLists should be deleted with <B>pfDelete</B> rather than
       the delete operator.

       <I>type</I> is a symbolic token that specifies a type of pfDis-
       pList and is either <B>PFDL_FLAT</B> or <B>PFDL_RING</B>.  A <B>PFDL_FLAT</B>
       display list is a linear list of commands and data while a
       <B>PFDL_RING</B> is configured as a ring buffer (FIFO).  A ring
       buffer is provided for multiprocessed paired producer and
       consumer applications where the producer writes to the
       buffer while the consumer simultaneously reads from, and
       draws the buffer.  OpenGL Performer automatically ensures
       ring buffer consistency by providing synchronization and
       mutual exclusion to processes on ring buffer full or empty
       conditions.  <B>pfDispList::getDListType</B> returns the type of
       a pfDispList.

       <B>pfDispList::getClassType</B> returns the <B>pfType</B>* for the class
       <B>pfDispList</B>.  The <B>pfType</B>* returned by
       <B>pfDispList::getClassType</B> is the same as the <B>pfType</B>*

       The <I>size</I> argument to <B>new</B> <B>pfDispList</B> gives a hint in words
       about how much storage the pfDispList will require.  If
       more storage is required, OpenGL Performer will automati-
       cally grow the pfDispList by <I>size</I> words at a time.  <I>arena</I>
       specifies the malloc arena out of which the pfDispList is
       allocated or NULL for allocation off the heap.
       <B>pfDispList::getSize</B> returns the size of <I>dlist</I> that was
       requested by <B>new</B> <B>pfDispList</B>, not its current size.

       <B>pfDispList::open</B> opens the pfDispList for appending and
       puts the calling process into display list mode.  When in
       display list mode, display-listable <B>libpr</B> commands are
       recorded in the currently active display list rather than
       being executed immediately.  libpr commands that may be
       recorded in a pfDispList say so in their respective man
       pages.  Only one pfDispList may be open at a time.
       <B>pfGetCurDList</B> returns the currently active display list or
       <B>NULL</B> if the calling process is in immediate mode.

       The currently active pfDispList is a global value but is
       stored in the PRDA process header so that <I>share</I> <I>group</I> <I>pro-</I>
       <I>cesses</I> (see <B>sproc</B>) need not share the same currently
       active pfDispList.

       The contents of one pfDispList may be appended to a second
       pfDispList with the function <B>pfDispList::append</B>.  All
       pfDispList elements in <I>src</I> are appended to the pfDispList
       on which the append method is invoked.

       Each pfDispList maintains head and tail pointers that
       indicate where in the list commands are to be appended and
       evaluated respectively.  Commands entered into the display
       list are appended after the head pointer and increment the
       head pointer appropriately.  Commands drawn by
       <B>pfDispList::draw</B> increment the tail pointer but do not
       remove commands from the list.  In the <B>PFDL_RING</B> case,
       OpenGL Performer ensures that the tail pointer does not
       overrun the head pointer and vice versa by spinning pro-
       cesses.

       Both head and tail pointers are reset to the beginning of
       the pfDispList by the <B>pfDispList::reset</B> member function so
       that any additions to the current pfDispList will over-
       write previously entered commands.  The tail pointers of
       flat lists are automatically reset by <B>pfDispList::draw</B>
       when the tail pointer reaches the head pointer so that the
       pfDispList may be rendered again from the beginning.

       The member function <B>pfDispList::close</B> 'closes' the active
       pfDispList and returns the application to immediate mode.

       For <B>PFDL_FLAT</B> display lists, <B>pfDispList::draw</B> traverses
       the pfDispList from the tail to the head pointer, and then
       resets the tail pointer to the beginning of the pfDis-
       pList.  If the pfDispList is a <B>PFDL_RING</B>, <B>pfDispList::draw</B>
       will continually draw the display list, returning control
       to the application only on <B>PFDL_END_OF_FRAME</B> or
       <B>PFDL_RETURN</B> commands (see <B>pfDispList::addCmd</B>).  After
       that send command tokens down the graphics pipeline.
       <B>pfDispList::draw</B> is itself a display-listable command pro-
       vided that pfDispList object is not the currently active
       pfDispList.  The return value is the end of frame,
       <B>PFDL_END_OF_FRAME</B>, forced return <B>PFDL_RETURN</B>, or end of
       list <B>PFDL_END_OF_LIST</B> token will be returned or else -1 if
       an error is encountered.  If the current pfDispList mode
       is <B>PFDL_MODE_COMPILE_GL</B>, the <B>PFDL_END_OF_LIST</B> token will
       be returned.

       <B>pfDispList::compile</B> will compile a pfDispList into a GL
       display list. The return value is that from
       <B>pfDispList::draw</B> and will be -1 if an error is encoun-
       tered.  Note that user callback functions in pfDispLists
       are only exectued upon display list creation.

       <B>pfDispList::setMode</B> sets the specified <I>mode</I> to the given
       value.  The supported mode is <B>PFDL_MODE_COMPILE_GL</B> and
       when set to 1, this causes the associated GL display list
       to be drawn when <B>pfDispList::draw</B> is called and a new GL
       display list will be auto-created if one does not exist or
       of the current display list is dirty. By default,
       <B>PFDL_MODE_COMPILE_GL</B> is false.  User callback functions in
       pfDispLists are only exectued upon display list creation.
       <B>pfDispList::getMode</B> returns the current value of <I>mode</I>.

       The following example draws a pfGeoSet into a pfDispList
       and then subsequently draws the pfDispList:

       /* Open DList and append GSet */
       dlist-&gt;open();
       pfEnable(PFEN_WIREFRAME);
       gset-&gt;draw();

       /* Close DList and return to immediate mode */
       pfDispList::close();

       /* Draw 'gset' in wireframe */
       dlist-&gt;draw();

       <B>pfDispList::callback</B> allows custom rendering in the middle
       of a display list by putting a function callback and data
       in the current display list.  Up to 64 bytes of user-data
       may be copied into the display list.  <I>nbytes</I> specifies the
       length of data that <I>data</I> references.  When a callback
       token is encountered while drawing a display list, the
       function <I>callback</I> will be called with a pointer to the
       user data that is cached in the display list.  A callback
       may call <B>pfPushState</B> upon entering and <B>pfPopState</B> when
       leaving to ensure that any state changes made in the call-
       back will be not inherited by subsequent geometry.

       <B>pfDispList::addCmd</B> adds <I>cmd</I> to the currently active dis-
       play list.  <I>cmd</I> is one of the following symbolic tokens,
       both of which return control to the application but indi-
       cate different situations.
              <B>PFDL_RETURN</B>
              <B>PFDL_END_OF_FRAME</B>

       being built by eliminating redundant mode changes and by
       unwinding pfGeoStates into their component parts.  As a
       result, modifications to objects after they are placed in
       a pfDispList may be ignored by the pfDispList.  To be
       safe, do not modify any objects that were placed in one or
       more pfDispLists.

       Here is an example of this phenomenon:

       /* Attach gstate0 to gset */
       gset-&gt;setGState(gstate0);

       /* Open dlist as current pfDispList */
       dlist-&gt;open();
       gset-&gt;draw();

       /* Return to immediate mode */
       pfDispList::close();

       /* Attach gstate1 to gset */
       gset-&gt;setGState(gstate1);

       /*
        * dlist will use gstate0 and not be aware that gset was modified to
        * use gstate1.
        */
       dlist-&gt;draw();



   <B>Preprocessing</B> <B>a</B> <B>Display</B> <B>List</B>
       The following routines are useful in <B>libpr</B>-only applica-
       tions; <B>libpf</B> applications do not need to call these rou-
       tines.  Preprocessing of the light point display list is
       automatically managed by the <B>libpf</B> Light Point process
       (see <B>pfConfig</B>).

       <B>pfDispList::preprocess</B> is used to preprocess a display
       list in order to accelerate it's handling in the draw pro-
       cess.  This call must be encapsulated between the open and
       close of another pfDispList.  It is just like drawing a
       pfDispList into another one.

       The <I>flag</I> is a bit field that indicates which preprocessing
       is to be done. Currently only <B>PFDL_PREPROCESS_LPSTATE</B>
       (which computes the appearance of each light point) is
       defined. See <B>pfLPointState</B> and <B>pfCalligraphic</B> for further
       information.

       Preprocessing makes sense only if it is done in a separate
       process, so that these computations can be done while the
       Draw Process is drawing other display lists. Typically,
       the Draw Process will draw the polygons of the scene while
       the Preprocessing process is performing the light point
       computations. This is what the Light Point Process does in
       libpf.

       Given that <I>lpointDrawDList</I> is an empty RING Display List,
       and that <I>lpointPreprocessDList</I> is a FLAT Display List that
       pfViewMat(viewMat);
       // can be obtain from invMat.invertOrthoN(viewMat);
       // and also not mandatory. Will be computed from viewMat if not given
       pfInvViewMat(invViewMat);
       // needed to compute true projected pixel size
       pfNearPixDist(nearPixDist);
       // can use getGLProjMat from a Frustum to get this matrix
       pfProjMat(projMat);
       // Open the Draw RING Display List
       lpointDrawDList-&gt;open();
       // preprocess the LPoint FLAT Display List
       lpointPreprocessDList-&gt;preprocess(PFDL_PREPROCESS_LPSTATE);
       // Post an end of frame token in the ring Dlist
       pfDispList::addCmd(PFDL_END_OF_FRAME);
       // Close the Draw RING Display List
       pfDispList::close();


       Note that pfSelectCalligraphic, pfViewMat, pfInvViewMat,
       pfNearPixDist and pfProjMat are all Display List-able, and
       should not go in the lpointDrawDList, as they are needed
       to configure the preprocessing.

       Also, processing of pfLPointState requires that the
       <B>pfModelMat()</B> matrix are stored in the lpointPreprocess-
       DList each time the model matrix changes before drawing a
       pfGeoSet. This is done automatically by the Culler in a
       <B>libpf</B> application.

       So, the Draw Process simply looks like this:

       // do usual Channel settings
       // including pfPixScale if using DVR
       pfPixScale(scale);
       // draw the polygons
       polygonDList-&gt;draw();
       // draw the light point Draw Ring DLIST
       lpointDrawDList-&gt;draw();
       //  will exit at the EndOfFrame token
       // whatever
       // then swapbuffer


       Note that in the case of calligraphic light points it is
       mandatory that the lpoints are the last geometric elements
       sent to the graphic pipe.
