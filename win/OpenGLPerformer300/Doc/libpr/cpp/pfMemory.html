       from  pfMemory,  they  inherit  the  functionality  of the
       pfMemory routines described here.  In practice this  means
       you  can  use the pfMemory routines listed above with most
       any OpenGL Performer object, such as  pfMaterial,  pfList,
       pfFog,  pfFrustum,  pfChannel,  pfGroup, pfGeode or with a
       data pointer returned by <B>pfMemory::malloc</B>.

       pfMemory supports the following:

              1.     Typed data structures.

              2.     Memory arena allocation.

              3.     Memory chunks which know their size.

              4.     Reference counting.

       with only a 4 word overhead.

       Although the OpenGL Performer  general  memory  allocation
       routines (<B>pfMemory::malloc</B>) create pfMemories, they return
       void* so the application can treat the allocation  as  raw
       data.  Consequently, all routines that would normally take
       a pfMemory* take a void* and infer the pfMemory handle  so
       that  applications  can treat pfMemory as raw memory. How-
       ever, one caveat is that routines which  take  raw  memory
       such  as <B>pfGeoSet::setAttr</B> or <B>pfMemory::free</B> should not be
       passed a pointer to static data since the routines may not
       be able to successfully infer the pfMemory handle from the
       void*.

                ---------------


       Routines which convert between pfMemory* and void* are:

              void* -&gt; pfMemory*: <B>pfMemory::getMemory</B>

              pfMemory* -&gt; void*: <B>pfMemory::getData</B>


       Note that is it legal to pass either a pfMemory* or a
       void* to those routines which are prototyped as accepting
       a void*, e.g., <B>pfMemory::ref</B>. In this way, a single set of
       routines supports the same feature set including reference
       counts, copy, and delete for pfMemories used as OpenGL
       Performer data types like pfGeoSet as well as for pfMemo-
       types, when decisions are made based on the type of an
       object, it is usually better to use  the member function
       <B>isOfType</B> to test if an object is of a type derived from a
       Performer type rather than to test for strict equality of
       the <B>pfType</B>*'s.

       All objects derived from pfMemory have a type identifier
       (pfType*) that is returned by the member function <B>getType</B>.
       Most Performer types are derived from other Performer
       types with the derived type taking on the functionality
       and routines associated with its parent type.  This type
       inheritance allows routines associated with a type to be
       used with any types derived from it.  For example pfDCS is
       derived from pfGroup.


       Example 1: API sharing.

       dcs = new pfDCS;

       /* pfDCS uses pfGroup routine */
       dcs-&gt;addChild(geode);

       /* pfDCS uses pfNode routine */
       dcs-&gt;setTravMask(PFTRAV_ISECT, DCS_MASK, PFTRAV_SELF | PFTRAV_DESCEND, PF_SET);


       Each data type derived from pfMemory has an associated
       routine for getting a pointer to its corresponding pfType,
       e.g.  <B>pfDCS::getClassType()</B> returns the pfType* corre-
       sponding to the pfDCS class.  The exact type of an object
       is tested by comparing its pfType* to that returned by one
       of these *::getClassType routines or with the
       <B>pfMemory::isExactType</B> test, e.g.


            if (obj-&gt;getType == pfGroup::getClassType()) ...

            if (obj-&gt;IsExactType(pfGroup::getClassType())) ...



       But since OpenGL Performer allows subclassing and the cre-
       ation of new types in C++, it's more often desirable to
       know whether a particular object is of a type derived from
       a particular type defined by OpenGL Performer.  In partic-
       ular, exact type tests makes application code more likely
       to fail on scene graphs produced by database loaders that
       use subclassing.  <B>pfMemory::isOfType</B> performs this test
       and returns TRUE if the object's type is derived from
       <I>type</I>:

            if (obj-&gt;isOfType(pfGroup::getClassType())) ...

       If 'obj' is a pfDCS, then the above conditional would
       evaluate TRUE since pfDCS is derived from pfGroup.

       <B>pfMemory::getTypeName</B> returns a string that identifies the
       type of the object.  For example, if the object is a
       which is still being used, i.e., its reference count is
       greater than 0.

       Reference counts may be incremented and decremented by
       <B>pfMemory::ref</B> and <B>pfMemory::unref</B> respectively.
       <B>pfMemory::getRef</B> returns the reference count of the
       object.  <B>pfMemory::unrefGetRef</B> decrements the reference
       count and returns the new value, as an atomic operation,
       i.e. it is guaranteed that no other process can change the
       value or free the memory between the decrement and the
       time the value is read.  <B>pfBuffer::unrefDelete</B> will decre-
       ment the reference count of the object and delete it if
       the count is &lt;= 0.  Thus it is equivalent to calling
       <B>pfMemory::unref</B> followed by <B>pfBuffer::checkDelete</B>, as an
       atomic operation.

       <B>pfMemory::checkDelete</B> frees the memory associated with the
       object if its reference count is &lt;= 0.  When an object is
       freed, it decrements the reference count of all pfMemories
       that it once referenced and will delete any of these
       pfMemories with reference counts that are &lt;= 0.  Thus,
       <B>pfBuffer::checkDelete</B> will follow all reference chains
       until it encounters a pfMemory which it cannot delete.
       Note that the reference count of a pfNode is incremented
       each time it is added as a child to a pfGroup. Thus, a
       pfNode must be removed from all its parents before it can
       be deleted.

       When multiprocessing in a <B>libpf</B> application, pfNodes
       should be <B>pfDelete</B>ed only in the APP or DBASE processes as
       should <B>libpr</B> objects that are referenced directly or indi-
       rectly by pfNodes, like pfGeoSets and pfGeoStates. If you
       wish to delete objects in processes other than the APP or
       DBASE, use <B>pfAsyncDelete</B>.

       Example 2: Deletion


       pfMaterial     *mtl;
       pfTexture *tex;
       pfGeoState     *brickStyle, *woodStyle;
       pfGeoSet  *brickWall, *woodWall;

       mtl = new pfMaterial;

       brickStyle = new pfGeoState;
       tex = new pfTexture;
       tex-&gt;loadFile("brick.rgb");
       brickStyle-&gt;setAttr(PFSTATE_TEXTURE, tex);
       brickStyle-&gt;setAttr(PFSTATE_FRONTMTL, mtl);

       woodStyle = new pfGeoState;
       tex = new pfTexture;
       tex-&gt;loadFile("wood.rgb");
       woodStyle-&gt;setAttr(PFSTATE_TEXTURE, tex);
       woodStyle-&gt;setAttr(PFSTATE_FRONTMTL, mtl);

       brickWall = new pfGeoSet;
       brickWall-&gt;setGState(brickStyle);

       /* At this point woodWall, woodStyle, and the wood texture
        * have been deleted. coords and mtl have not been deleted
        * since they are referenced by brickWall and brickStyle respectively.
       */



       <B>pfBuffer::checkDelete</B> returns the following:

              tab($) ; c l .  FALSE$the object was not deleted
              TRUE$the object was deleted -1$the object is not a
              pfMemory

       <B>pfBuffer::checkDelete</B> is implemented for all OpenGL Per-
       former objects except the following:

              pfPipe
              pfChannel
              pfEarthSky
              pfBuffer
              pfPipeWindow
              pfTraverser
              pfState
              pfDataPool

       <B>pfMemory::isFluxed</B> returns TRUE if a pfMemory is actually
       the data portion of a pfFluxMemory that is part of a
       pfFlux.  It returns FALSE otherwise.  Calling
       <B>pfMemory::ref</B>, <B>pfMemory::unref</B>, <B>pfMemory::unrefDelete</B>,
       <B>pfMemory::unrefGetRef</B>, <B>pfMemory::getRef</B>, or
       <B>pfMemory::checkDelete</B> on a Fluxed pfMemory, will actually
       call the function on the parent pfFlux.

       <B>pfMemory::copy</B> copies <I>src</I> into <I>dst</I>.  <B>pfMemory::copy</B> is not
       recursive - it does not follow reference chains but
       instead copies only the first- level references. The ref-
       erence counts of objects newly referenced by <I>dst</I> are
       incremented by one while those counts of objects previ-
       ously reverenced by <I>dst</I> are decremented by one. Objects
       whose reference counts reach 0 during <B>pfMemory::copy</B> are
       <I>not</I> deleted.  A value of <B>TRUE</B> will be returned if the copy
       successfully completes and <B>FALSE</B> will be returned if an
       error is encountered.  If the destination object is a
       growable object (such as a <B>pfList</B>) then it will automati-
       cally grow as needed and as memory permits to hold the
       copy of the source object.  If the destination object is
       not a growable object and the <I>src</I> object is larger than
       the destination object, no copy will be done and a value
       of <B>FALSE</B> will be returned.

       <B>pfMemory::copy</B> is currently not implemented for any libpf
       data structures and is not implemented for the following
       libpr data structures:

              pfState
              pfDataPool

       <B>pfMemory::compare</B> compares the object <I>p1</I> to the object <I>p2</I>.
       Derived classes first compare their parent classes.  If
       objects of different types are compared, they will be
       found to be different and the return value will be based
       on a comparison of the <I>p1</I> and <I>p2</I> pointer values.

       <B>pfMemory::print</B> Prints information to a file about the
       specified object.  The <I>file</I> argument specifies the file.
       The non-static virtual <B>pfMemory::print</B> takes a prefix
       string <I>prefix</I> which is prepended to the message part of
       the printed statements and which may be NULL to indicate
       no prefix.  If <I>file</I> is <B>NULL</B>, the listing is printed to
       stderr.  <B>pfMemory::print</B> takes a verbosity indicator, <I>ver-</I>
       <I>bose</I>.  Valid selections in order of increasing verbosity
       are:

              tab($) ; l l .  <B>PFPRINT_VB_OFF</B>$no printing
              <B>PFPRINT_VB_ON</B>$minimal printing (default)
              <B>PFPRINT_VB_NOTICE</B>$minimal printing (default)
              <B>PFPRINT_VB_INFO</B>$considerable printing
              <B>PFPRINT_VB_DEBUG</B>$exhaustive printing

       If <I>mem</I> is a type of pfNode, then <I>which</I> specifies whether
       the print traversal should only traverse the current node
       (<B>PFTRAV_SELF</B>) or print out the entire scene graph rooted
       by node <I>mem</I> by traversing <I>node</I> and its descendents in the
       graph (<B>PFTRAV_SELF</B> | <B>PFTRAV_DESCEND</B>).  If <I>mem</I> is a
       pfFrameStats, then <I>which</I> specifies a bitmask of frame
       statistics classes that should be printed.  If <I>mem</I> is a
       pfGeoSet, then <I>which</I> is ignored and information about that
       pfGeoSet is printed according to the verbosity indicator.
       The output contains the types, names and bounds of the
       nodes and pfGeoSets in the hierarchy.  This routine is
       provided for debugging purposes only and the content and
       format may change in future releases.


       Example 3: Print entire contents of a pfGeoSet, <I>gset</I>, to
       stderr.

       gset-&gt;print(NULL, PFPRINT_VB_DEBUG, NULL);


       Example 4: Print entire scene graph under node to a file
       <I>file</I> with default verbosity.

       file = fopen ("scene.out","w");
       scene-&gt;print(PFTRAV_SELF | PFTRAV_DESCEND, PFPRINT_VB_ON, file);
       fclose(file);


       Example 5: Print select classes of a pfFrameStats struc-
       ture, <I>stats</I>, to stderr.

       stats-&gt;print(PFSTATS_ENGFX | PFFSTATS_ENDB | PFFSTATS_ENCULL, PFSTATS_ON, NULL);


       pfMemory::malloc and the related routines provide a con-
       sistent method to allocate memory, either from the user's
       heap (using the C-library <B>malloc</B> function) or from a
       specified to allocate the memory from.  If <I>arena</I> is NULL,
       memory is allocated from the heap, otherwise memory is
       allocated from <I>arena</I> which must be a previously configured
       shared memory arena (see pfSharedMem).  <B>new</B>(nbytes, arena)
       is equivalent to <B>pfMemory::malloc</B>(nbytes, arena).
       <B>new(nbytes)</B> is equivalent to pfMemory::malloc(nbytes,
       NULL).  "delete ptr" is equivalent to pfMalloc::free(ptr).
       Instances of pfMemory and derived classes must be explic-
       itly new'ed individually, i.e. they cannot be created
       statically, on the stack or in arrays.

       Shared memory arenas can be created using <B>acreate</B> and can
       be found by using <B>pfGetSharedArena</B>.

       <B>pfMemory::calloc</B> and <B>pfMemory::realloc</B> function just as
       their Unix counterparts, except that they may use shared
       arenas.

       In all cases, a pointer to the allocated memory block is
       returned or NULL if there is not enough available memory.

       The data pointer returned by <B>pfMemory::malloc</B>,
       <B>pfMemory::calloc</B>, and <B>pfMemory::realloc</B> is actually part
       of a pfMemory object that, among other things, provides a
       reference count.  Reference counts are used to keep track
       of how many times each allocated block of memory is refer-
       enced or instanced.  All OpenGL Performer libpr objects
       (pfMemory) are created with <B>pfMemory::malloc</B> so their ref-
       erence counts are updated by appropriate libpr routines.
       Examples of references follow:

       Example 6:

       tex = new pfTexture;

       /* Attach 'tex' to gstate0 and gstate1 */
       gstate0-&gt;setAttr(PFSTATE_TEXTURE, tex);
       gstate1-&gt;setAttr(PFSTATE_TEXTURE, tex);

       /* The reference count of 'tex' is now 2 */

       /* Remove 'tex' from gstate1 */
       gstate1-&gt;setAttr(PFSTATE_TEXTURE, NULL);

       /* The reference count of 'tex' is now 1 */


       Example 7:

       coords = (pfVec3*) pfMalloc(sizeof(pfVec3) * numVerts, arena);

       /* Attach 'coords' to non-indexed pfGeoSet, 'gset' */
       gset-&gt;setAttr(PFGS_COORD3, PFGS_PER_VERTEX, coords, NULL);

       /* The reference count of 'coords' is now 1 */


       Example 8:

       is an error to <B>pfMemory::free</B> memory that was not allo-
       cated by <B>pfMemory::malloc</B>, <B>pfCalloc</B>, or <B>pfMemory::realloc</B>.
       It is also an error to use any method other than
       <B>pfMemory::free</B> or <B>pfBuffer::checkDelete</B> to free memory
       allocated by <B>pfMemory::malloc</B>, <B>pfMemory::calloc</B>, or
       <B>pfMemory::realloc</B>.

       <B>pfMemory::free</B> does not honor the reference count of <I>ptr</I>.
       This means that you can free a chunk of memory that is
       still being used (which means that its reference count is
       &gt; 0) with potentially disastrous results. Typical failure
       modes are in the form of mysterious memory corruption and
       segmentation violations.

       <B>pfBuffer::checkDelete</B>, however, does honor the reference
       count of <I>ptr</I> and will not delete any memory whose refer-
       ence count is &gt; 0.  <B>pfBuffer::checkDelete</B> returns -1 if
       <I>ptr</I> is not a pfMalloc pointer, TRUE if <I>ptr</I> was deleted,
       and FALSE otherwise.  <B>pfBuffer::checkDelete</B> is recommended
       if you are not sure of the reference count of a piece of
       memory.  See the pfObject reference page for more details
       on <B>pfBuffer::checkDelete</B>.

       <B>pfMemory::getMallocArena</B> returns the arena pointer which
       <I>ptr</I> was allocated from or NULL if <I>ptr</I> was allocated from
       the process heap.

       <B>pfMemory::getMallocSize</B> returns the size in bytes of the
       memory referenced by <I>ptr</I> or 0 if <I>ptr</I> is not a
       <B>pfMemory::malloc</B> pointer.

       <B>pfMemory::getArenaBytesUsed</B> returns the number of bytes
       currently allocated from the shared arena.  It takes into
       account all the Performer calls that allocate or free
       shared arena memory (<B>pfMalloc</B>, <B>pfCalloc</B>, <B>pfRealloc</B>,
       <B>pfDelete</B>, <B>pfFree</B>, new on any Performer class, etc).  This
       call is only available in the <I>DEBUG</I> libraries.  It is
       meant for debugging memory leaks and therefore is not nec-
       essary in the optimized libraries. If called with opti-
       mized libraries, it returns (-1). This call makes it eas-
       ier to distinguish between memory leaks and memory frag-
       mentation: If the arena grows but the number of bytes used
       doesn't then the program in question causes memory frag-
       mentation but doesn't leak.

       <B>pfStrdup</B> duplicates the NULL-terminated string <I>str</I> by
       allocating storage in the shared memory arena defined by
       the <I>arena</I> argument.
