<H2>PARENT CLASS FUNCTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The  OpenGL  Performer  class <B>pfSprite</B> is derived from the
       parent class <B>pfObject</B>, so each of these  member  functions
       of class <B>pfObject</B> are also directly usable with objects of
       class <B>pfSprite</B>.  This is also true for ancestor classes of
       class <B>pfObject</B>.

       void*   <B>pfObject::operator</B> <B>new</B>(size_t);
       void*   <B>pfObject::operator</B> <B>new</B>(size_t, void *arena);
       void*   <B>pfObject::operator</B>      <B>new</B>(size_t,     pfFluxMem-
                 ory *fmem);
       void    <B>pfObject::setUserData</B>(void *data);
       void    <B>pfObject::setUserData</B>(int slot, void *data);
       void*   <B>pfObject::getUserData</B>(pfObject *obj);
       void*   <B>pfObject::getUserData</B>(pfObject *obj, int slot);
       int     <B>pfObject::getNumUserData</B>();


       Since the class <B>pfObject</B> is itself derived from the parent
       class <B>pfMemory</B>, objects of class <B>pfSprite</B> can also be used
       with  these  functions  designed  for  objects  of   class
       <B>pfMemory</B>.

       void*          <B>pfMemory::getData</B>(const void *ptr);
       pfType *       <B>pfMemory::getType</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::isOfType</B>(pfType *type);
       void*          <B>pfMemory::getArena</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::ref</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::unref</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::unrefDelete</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::unrefGetRef</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::getRef</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::checkDelete</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::isFluxed</B>();
       void *         <B>pfMemory::getArena</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::getSize</B>();

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A "sprite" is a term borrowed from the video game industry
       and  refers  to  a  movable  graphical  object that always
       appears orthogonal to the viewer. In 2D, a sprite  can  be
       implemented  by  simply  drawing  an image that is aligned
       with  the  screen,  a  technique  called   "bit-blitting".
       pfSprite  extends  this support to 3D geometry by rotating
       the geometry appropriately based on the viewer and  object
       locations  to  achieve  a consistent screen alignment.  In
       this respect, pfSprite is not really  a  graphical  object
       itself,  rather it is an intelligent transformation and is
       logically grouped with other libpr  transformation  primi-
       tives like <B>pfMultMatrix</B>.

       Sprite   transformations   (subsequently  referred  to  as
       sprites) are useful for complex objects that  are  roughly
       symmetrical  about  an  axis  or a point.  By rotating the
       model about the axis or point, the viewer  only  sees  the
       "front"  of  the model so complexity is saved in the model
       by omitting the "back" geometry.   A  further  performance
       enhancement  is to incorporate visual complexity in a tex-
       ture map rather than in geometry.  Thus, on machines  with
       fast  texture  mapping,  sprites  can present very complex
       images with very little geometry. Classic examples of tex-
       tured sprites use a single quadrilateral that when rotated
       about a vertical axis  simulate  trees  and  when  rotated
       about a point simulate clouds or puffs of smoke.

       <B>new</B>(arena)  allocates a pfSprite from the specified memory
       arena, or from the heap if <I>arena</I> is NULL.  <B>new</B> allocates a
       pfSprite    from    the    default   memory   arena   (see
       <B>pfGetSharedArena</B>).  Like other pfObjects, pfSprites cannot
       be  created  statically,  automatically on the stack or in
       arrays.  pfSprites should be deleted with <B>pfDelete</B>  rather
       than the delete operator.

       <B>pfSprite::getClassType</B>  returns  the <B>pfType</B>* for the class
       <B>pfSprite</B>.  The <B>pfType</B>* returned by  <B>pfSprite::getClassType</B>
       is  the  same as the <B>pfType</B>* returned by invoking the vir-
       tual function <B>getType</B> on any instance of  class  <B>pfSprite</B>.
       Because  OpenGL  Performer  allows subclassing of built-in
       types, when decisions are made based on  the  type  of  an
       object,  it  is usually better to use  the member function
       <B>isOfType</B> to test if an object is of a type derived from  a
       Performer  type rather than to test for strict equality of
       the <B>pfType</B>*'s.

       Sprite transformations  are  simply  rotations  which  are

       The viewer's coordinate system is specified with <B>pfViewMat</B>
       whose last row is the viewer's location. The sprite  loca-
       tion    in    object   coordinates   is   specified   with
       <B>pfSprite::position</B>. This location is  transformed  by  the
       current  modeling matrix (<B>pfModelMat</B>) into "world" coordi-
       nates before computing the rotation based  on  the  sprite
       mode.

       <B>pfSprite::setMode</B>  sets  the <I>which</I> mode of the pfSprite to
       <I>val</I>.  <I>which</I> identifies a particular mode and is one of:

              <B>PFSPRITE_ROT</B> <I>val</I> specifies the rotation constraints
              of the pfSprite and is one of:

              <B>PFSPRITE_AXIAL_ROT</B>
                     The +Z object coordinate axis of geometry is
                     the axis of rotation,  i.e.  the  +Z  object
                     axis is rotated onto the sprite axis defined
                     by <B>pfSprite::setAxis</B> in eye space, then  the
                     transformed  -Y  axis  is  rotated about the
                     sprite axis to face the viewer as nearly  as
                     possible.

              <B>PFSPRITE_POINT_ROT_EYE</B>
                     The sprite rotation is constrained to rotate
                     about  the  sprite  location  specified   by
                     <B>pfSprite::position</B>.    The  object's  -Y  is
                     rotated to the eye's -Y (front vector),  and
                     then  the  objects's Z axis is rotated about
                     the front vector to point toward the  sprite
                     axis  (in eye coordinates) as nearly as pos-
                     sible.  In particular, if the sprite axis is
                     +Z   (the  default),  the  object  +Z  stays
                     upright on the screen.

              <B>PFSPRITE_POINT_ROT_WORLD</B>
                     This mode is identical to <B>PFSPRITE_AXIAL_ROT</B>
                     except  that  the sprite axis is interpreted
                     as world coordinates rather than eye coordi-
                     nates.

              The      default      <B>PFSPRITE_ROT</B>      mode     is
              <B>PFSPRITE_AXIAL_ROT</B>.

              <B>PFSPRITE_MATRIX_THRESHOLD</B>
                     pfGeoSets which contain a number of vertices
                     less than <I>val</I> will  be  transformed  on  the
                     CPU,   rather   than  through  the  Graphics
                     Library transformation stack. If  <I>sprite</I>  is
                     to  affect  non-pfGeoSet  geometry, then <I>val</I>
                     should be &lt;= 0 in which  case  the  Graphics
                     Library  transformation stack will always be
                     used.   Specifically,  <B>pfSprite::begin</B>  will
                     push  the  matrix  stack, <B>pfSprite::position</B>
                     will modify the top of stack with  the  cur-
                     rent sprite rotation, and <B>pfSprite::end</B> will
                     pop the matrix stack.  It is  not  necessary
                     to   push/pop   the   matrix   stack  within

       <B>pfSprite::getAxis</B> returns the axis of <I>sprite</I> in <I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, <I>z</I>.

       <B>pfSprite::begin</B>  makes  the  pfSprite the current pfSprite
       and applies its effects to  subsequently  drawn  pfGeoSets
       and non-pfGeoSet geometry if the pfSprite's matrix thresh-
       old value  is  &lt;=  0.   <B>pfSprite::position</B>  specifies  the
       sprite  origin and <B>pfSprite::end</B> sets the current pfSprite
       to <B>NULL</B> and exits "sprite mode".   <B>pfSprite::position</B>  may
       be  called  outside  <B>pfSprite::begin/pfSprite::end</B> and any
       number of times  within  <B>pfSprite::begin/pfSprite::end</B>  to
       render  geometry  with  many  different  origins but which
       share the characteristics of the pfSprite.

       Example 1: Draw trees as axial sprites which rotate  about
       +Z.


       pfVec3         treeOrg[NUMTREES];
       pfGeoSet  *trees[NUMTREES];

       sprite = new pfSprite;
       sprite-&gt;begin();

       for (i=0; i&lt;NUMTREES; i++)
       {
           pfSprite::position(treeOrg[i][0], treeOrg[i][1], treeOrg[i][1]);
           trees[i]-&gt;draw();
       }

       pfSprite::end();


       <B>pfSprite::begin</B>, <B>pfSprite::end</B>, and <B>pfSprite::position</B> are
       all display-listable commands.   If a pfDispList has been
       opened by <B>pfDispList::open</B>, these commands will not have
       immediate effect but will be captured by the pfDispList
       and will only have effect when that pfDispList is later
       drawn with <B>pfDispList::draw</B>.

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Both <B>PFSPRITE_AXIAL_ROT</B> and <B>PFSPRITE_POINT_ROT_WORLD</B>
       sprites may "spin" about the Y axis of the pfGeoSet when
       viewed along the rotation or alignment axis.
