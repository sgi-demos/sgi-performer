</PRE>
<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       <I>dpool</I>  identifies a pfDataPool.


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A  pfDataPool  is  similar to a shared memory malloc arena
       but adds the ability to lock/unlock pfDataPool memory  for
       multiprocessing   applications.   The  datapool  functions
       allow related or unrelated processes  to  share  data  and
       provide  a means for locking data blocks to eliminate data
       collision.  These functions use the shared arena functions
       (see <B>usinit</B>).

       <B>pfDataPool::create</B>  creates  and  returns  a  handle  to a
       pfDataPool.  <I>size</I> is the size in bytes of the  pfDataPool.
       <I>name</I> is the name of the pfDataPool and is also the name of
       the memory-mapped file used by the pfDataPool.  This  file
       is created in the directory "/usr/tmp" unless the environ-
       ment variable <B>PFTMPDIR</B> is defined, in which case the  file
       is created in the directory named in the <B>PFTMPDIR</B> environ-
       ment variable.  <I>name</I> should be unique among all pfDataPool
       names  and  only  a  single  process should create a given
       pfDataPool with name <I>name</I>.

       <B>pfDataPool::getClassType</B> return the <B>pfType</B>* for the  class
       <B>pfDataPool</B>.   The  <B>pfType</B>*  returned  is  the  same as the
       <B>pfType</B>* returned by invoking <B>getType</B> on  any  instance  of
       class  <B>pfDataPool</B>.   Because  OpenGL Performer allows sub-
       classing of built-in types, when decisions are made  based
       on  the  type  of  an  object, it is usually better to use
       <B>isOfType</B> to test if an object is of a type derived from  a
       Performer  type rather than to test for strict equality of
       the <B>pfType</B>*'s.

       The   member   functions   <B>pfDataPool::getDPoolSize</B>    and
       <B>pfDataPool::getName</B>  respectively return the size in bytes
       and the string name of a pfDataPool.

       <B>pfDataPool::attach</B> allows the calling process to attach to
       processes may still access it.  Additionally,  a  released
       pfDataPool  will be removed from the file system (deleted)
       once all attached processes  exit.   The  member  function
       <B>release</B> returns <B>TRUE</B> if successful and <B>FALSE</B> otherwise.

       <B>pfDataPool::alloc</B>  returns  a pointer to a block of memory
       of <I>size</I> bytes that was allocated out of the pfDataPool  or
       <B>NULL</B>  if there is not enough available memory.  <I>size</I> is in
       bytes and can range from 1 to the size of the  pfDataPool.
       The actual size allocated is always rounded up to the next
       16 byte boundary.  <I>id</I> is an integer  id  assigned  to  the
       block of memory that is used to reference it by the member
       function <B>find</B>.  Block id's should be unique or the results
       are undefined.

       <B>pfDataPool::find</B>  returns  a  pointer to a block of pfDat-
       aPool memory which is identified by <I>id</I> or <B>NULL</B> if  <I>id</I>  was
       not  found.   The  calling process must be attached to the
       datapool memory.

       The member function <B>free</B> frees the memory block previously
       allocated  by  <B>alloc</B>  and makes it available to be reallo-
       cated.

       <B>pfDataPool::lock</B> and <B>pfDataPool::unlock</B>  lock  and  unlock
       access  to a block of pfDataPool memory that was allocated
       by <B>pfDataPool::alloc</B>.  When the lock cannot  be  acquired,
       <B>pfDataPool::lock</B>  yields the processor causing the current
       thread to block until the lock is available.  Extra  argu-
       ments to <B>pfDataPool::lock</B> provides more control by accept-
       ing arguments to control the spinning and blocking.   When
       <I>block</I>  is  <I>FALSE</I>,  <B>pfDataPool::lock</B>  returns  rather  than
       yielding the processor if the  lock  cannot  be  acquired.
       <I>spins</I>  specifies the number of times to spin before yield-
       ing or  returning.   A  <I>spins</I>  value  of  -1  invokes  the
       default,  currently  600.  <B>pfDataPool::lock</B> returns 1 upon
       acquisition of the lock, 0 upon  failure  to  acquire  the
       lock  and  -1 upon error.  <B>pfDataPool::unlock</B> relinquishes
       the lock on the block of memory.

       There are a fixed number of locks (currently  4096)  allo-
       cated  for each pfDataPool and a new lock is consumed when
       an allocation in that pfDataPool is first locked.   Subse-
       quent releases and locks do not require further lock allo-
       cations.

       Example:

       typedef struct SharedData
       {
       float a, b, c;
       } SharedData;

       pfDataPool *pool;
       SharedData *data;
        :
       /* create a DataPool with room for 4 SharedData structures */
       pool = pfDataPool::create(4*sizeof(SharedData), "dpoolForSharedData");

       data-&gt;c = 407.0;
       pfDataPool::unlock((void*)data);


       <B>pfDataPool::lock</B> attempts to acquire a hardware lock asso-
       ciated with <I>dpmem</I>.  If another process has already
       acquired the lock, the calling process will not return
       until the lock is acquired.  Whether the process blocks or
       spins is a function of the machine configuration.  (see
       <B>usconfig</B>).  <B>pfDataPool::unlock</B> unlocks <I>dpmem</I>.  A process
       which double-trips a lock by calling the member function
       <B>lock</B> twice in succession will block until the lock is
       unset by another process.  A process may unlock a lock
       that was locked by a different process.  <B>pfDataPool::test</B>
       returns 0 if <I>dpmem</I> is unlocked and 1 if it is locked.

       pfDataPool memory may be accessed without using the lock
       and unlock feature; however this defeats the mutual exclu-
       sion feature provided by pfDataPool functions.

       A data pool must occupy the same range of virtual memory
       addresses in all processes that attach to it.
       <B>pfDataPool::attach</B> will fail if something else has already
       been mapped into the required address space, e.g. as a
       result of mmap or sbrk.  To minimize this risk, the member
       function <B>create</B> tries to place new datapools above the
       main shared memory arena created by <B>pfInitArenas</B>.  The
       address at which the next datapool will be created can be
       overridden by calling <B>pfDataPool::setAttachAddr</B> with the
       <I>addr</I> argument specifying the desired address.  An <I>addr</I> of
       NULL tells Performer to return to its normal placement
       efforts.  The next attachment address is returned by
       <B>pfDataPool::getAttachAddr</B>.

       In the absence of a shared memory arena created by
       <B>pfInitArenas</B>, <B>create</B> lets the kernel choose the data pool
       placement.

       Deleting a data pool with <B>pfDelete</B> or delete unmaps the
       data pool from virtual memory as well as deleting the
       pfDataPool data structure.



</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       pfDataPool functionality is not currently supported under
       the single processor version of Performer on Linux.

       When a datapool is created, a file is created in
       "/usr/tmp" or <B>PFTMPDIR</B>.  The file name will end with the
       string ".pfdpool".  If <B>pfDataPool::release</B> is not called
       to unlink the datapool, this file will remain in the file
       system after the program exits, taking up disk space.

       When using pfDataPools between unrelated processes, you
       can reduce memory conflicts by having the application that
       uses more virtual memory create the datapool and having
       the smaller application attach to the datapool before
       allocating memory that might cause conflicts.  Alter-
       nately, if an address is known to be safe for both appli-
