<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       <B>pfAntialias,</B> <B>pfGetAntialias</B> - Specify antialiasing mode


</PRE>
<H2>FUNCTION SPECIFICATION</H2><PRE>
       #include &lt;Performer/pr.h&gt;

       void   <B>pfAntialias</B>(int mode);

       int    <B>pfGetAntialias</B>(void);


</PRE>
<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       <I>mode</I>  is a symbolic constant and is one of:

             <B>PFAA_OFF</B>            Antialiasing will be disabled.

             <B>PFAA_ON</B>             Antialiasing  will  be  enabled.
                                 The antialiasing mechanism  used
                                 depends on the machine type.


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>pfAntialias</B> sets the hardware antialiasing mode.  Geometry
       drawn  subsequent   to   calling   <B>pfAntialias</B>   will   be
       antialiased according to <I>mode</I>.  The antialiasing mechanism
       used is machine-dependent: multisampling on  InfiniteReal-
       ity and RealityEngine systems and non-multisampling on all
       others.   In  addition,  if  available,  <B>pfAntialias</B>  will
       enable  a  special  hardware mode that efficiently renders
       points using multisampled  circles  rather  than  squares.
       See the <B>SGIS_multisample</B> section of the OpenGL <B>glIntro(3g)</B>
       man page for more  detailed  information  on  multisampled
       antialiasing.

       If <I>mode</I> is <B>PFAA_ON</B>, then antialiasing will be enabled.  On
       machines which do not support multisampling, <B>PFAA_ON</B>  will
       enable  line  and/or point antialiasing if either are sup-
       ported in hardware.  Polygons will not be antialiased.  In
       this  case  it  is recommended that <B>pfAntialias</B> be enabled
       only for points and lines since it may reduce the speed of
       polygon  rendering.   Line  or  point  antialiasing can be
       explicitly enabled by specifying  either  <B>PFAA_LINE_SMOOTH</B>
       or <B>PFAA_POINT_SMOOTH</B> as the <I>mode</I> for <B>pfAntialias</B>.

       X  windows  cannot have their framebuffer resources recon-
       figured.  X windows for OpenGL are,  by  default,  created
       with multisample buffers if they are available in the cur-
       rent hardware configuration.  The  default  configuration,
       if  available  will  be  8  subsamples,  24  bits of depth
       buffer, and 4 bits of stencil.  If this is not  available,
       1  bit of stencil will be used, and then 4 subsamples will
       be allocated if 8 are  not  still  available.   The  exact
       framebuffer  configuration of windows can be specified via
       <B>pfWindow::setFBConfigAttrs</B>.

       For X windows, if <I>mode</I> is <B>PFAA_OFF</B>, the antialiasing  mode
       will be disabled but the buffers cannot be deallocated and
       <B>pfGeoState::setMode</B>  to  set  the  antialiasing  mode of a
       pfGeoState and  with  <B>pfOverride</B>  to  override  subsequent
       antialiasing mode changes.

       <B>pfAntialias</B>  is  a  display-listable command.  If a pfDis-
       pList has been  opened  by  <B>pfDispList::open</B>,  <B>pfAntialias</B>
       will not have immediate effect but will be captured by the
       pfDispList and will only have effect when that  pfDispList
       is later drawn with <B>pfDispList::draw</B>.

       <B>pfGetAntialias</B> returns the current antialiasing mode.

       Example 1:

       /* Set up 'antialiased' pfGeoState */
       gstate-&gt;setMode(PFSTATE_ANTIALIAS, PFAA_ON);

       /* Attach gstate to gset */
       gset-&gt;setGState(gstate);

       /* Draw antialiased gset */
       gset-&gt;draw();


       Example 2:

       /* Override antialiasing mode to PFAA_OFF */
       pfAntialias(PFAA_OFF);
       pfOverride(PFSTATE_ANTIALIAS, PF_ON);



</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       <B>pfQueryFeature</B> can be used to determined what features are
       available on the current hardware configuration.
       <B>pfQuerySys</B> can be used to query the exact extent of hard-
       ware resources, such as number of subsamples available for
       multisampling.

       When using antialiasing without multisampling, blending is
       used which may conflict with other transparency modes.
       Specifically, all geometry will be blended which may cause
       artifacts and may substantially reduce performance.  For
       this reason <B>pfAntialias</B> should be used with discretion on
       all but InfiniteReality and RealityEngine systems.

       In the default framebuffer configurations, the 4 bit of
       stencil buffer is allocated to support depth complexity
       fill statistics; see the <B>pfStats</B> man page for more infor-
       mation.  1 bit of stencil is required for the support of
       high quality decals; see the <B>pfDecal</B> man page for more
       information.

       Not all machines support stencil planes and in these
       cases, stencil bits will not be allocated.  The Extreme
       graphics platforms only support stencil with reduced depth
       buffer resolution and so stencil will not be allocated by
       default.

       If a window has been configured with multisample buffers,
       undefined.
