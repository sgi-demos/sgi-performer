<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       <I>mode</I>  is a symbolic constant specifying  a  decaling  mode
             and is one of:

             <B>PFDECAL_OFF</B>
                  Decaling is off

             <B>PFDECAL_BASE</B>
                  Subsequent  drawn  geometry is considered to be
                  'base' geometry. Use the default decaling mech-
                  anism.

             <B>PFDECAL_LAYER</B>
                  Subsequent  drawn  geometry is considered to be
                  'layered' geometry. Use  the  default  decaling
                  mechanism.

             <B>PFDECAL_BASE_FAST</B>, <B>PFDECAL_LAYER_FAST</B>
                  Use  a  decaling  mechanism  appropriate to the
                  hardware that produces  the  fastest,  but  not
                  necessarily the highest quality, decaling.

             <B>PFDECAL_BASE_HIGH_QUALITY</B>,
             <B>PFDECAL_LAYER_HIGH_QUALITY</B>
                  Use  a  decaling  mechanism  appropriate to the
                  hardware that produces the highest quality, but
                  not necessarily the fastest, decaling.

             <B>PFDECAL_BASE_DISPLACE</B>, <B>PFDECAL_LAYER_DISPLACE</B>
                  Use   the  polygon  displacement  technique  (-
                  <B>glPolygonOffsetEXT</B> in OpenGL) to slightly  dis-
                  place the depth values of layer geometry <I>toward</I>
                  the eyepoint.

             <B>PFDECAL_BASE_DISPLACE</B>, <B>PFDECAL_LAYER_DISPLACE_AWAY</B>
                  Use  the  polygon  displacement  technique   (-
                  <B>glPolygonOffsetEXT</B>  in OpenGL) to slightly dis-
                  place the depth values of layer  geometry  <I>away</I>
                  from the eyepoint.

                  Use the current decal reference plane to  force
                  all decal geometry to be rendered with the same
                  plane equation.

       The constant <B>PFDECAL_PLANE</B> may be specified alone or OR'ed
       with one of the above modes to enable the use of reference
       planes for the base and layer geometry. When these  planes
       are  specified,  subsequent geometry is forced to be truly
       coplanar with the reference plane.  Displace  and  stencil
       operations  happen  on  the  planed  geometry.   Reference
       planes  may  be  specified  in  the  global   state   with
       <B>pfApplyDecalPlane</B>,    in    the    pfGeoState   with   the
       <B>PFSTATE_DECAL_PLANE</B> attribute, and on the pfGeoSet  itself
       with <B>pfGeoSet::setDecalPlane</B>.  Setting reference planes on
       pfGeoSets directly may help improve performance by  allow-
       ing  better  re-use  of pfGeoStates but will also slightly
       slow the handling of the pfGeoSet.  Reference  planes  are
       only supported under OpenGL operation and require the ref-
       erence_plane   SGI   extension   to   the   OpenGL.    The
       <B>PFQFTR_DECAL_PLANE</B>  to <B>pfQueryFeature</B> can be used for run-
       time queries for the support of decal reference planes.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       In some cases, such as when drawing stripes on  a  runway,
       it is easier to draw coplanar polygons than it is to model
       the geometry without coplanar faces.  However, on Z-buffer
       based  machines,  coplanar  polygons  can  cause  unwanted
       visual artifacts because  the  visual  priorities  of  the
       coplanar polygons are subject to the finite numerical pre-
       cision of the graphics pipeline. This results in a  "torn"
       appearance and "twinkling" from frame to frame.

       Decaled  geometry  can be thought of as a stack where each
       layer has visual priority over the geometry beneath it  in
       the  stack.   An  example  of  a 3 layer stack consists of
       stripes which are layered over a runway which  is  layered
       over the ground. The bottommost layer is called the "base"
       while the other layers are called  "decals"  or  "layers".
       When     using     certain    hardware    mechanisms    (-
       <B>PFDECAL_BASE_STENCIL</B>) to implement pfDecal, the "base"  is
       special because it defines the depth values which are used
       to determine layer visibility with respect to other  scene
       geometry and which are written to the depth buffer.

       Certain  decaling  mechanisms  (currently  only  <B>DISPLACE</B>)
       require that each layer in the layer stack  be  identified
       for   proper   rendering.    The  <B>PFDECAL_LAYER_1</B>  through
       <B>PFDECAL_LAYER_7</B> tokens are provided for this  purpose  and
       should  be  logically  OR'ed  into  the  layer mode, e.g.,
       <B>PFDECAL_LAYER_DISPLACE</B> | <B>PFDECAL_LAYER_2</B>.  Note  that  the
       layer identifier is extracted from the mode as follows:

       layerId = (mode &amp; <B>PFDECAL_LAYER_MASK</B>) &gt;&gt; <B>PFDECAL_LAYER_SHIFT</B>;


       <B>pfDecal</B> is used to draw visually correct coplanar polygons
       that are arranged as 'base' and 'layer' polygons as shown
       here:
       pfDecal(PFDECAL_LAYER_DISPLACE);
        :
       /* draw layer geometry using OpenGL Performer or graphics library */
        :
       /* Prepare to draw second layer polygons */
       pfDecal(PFDECAL_LAYER_DISPLACE | PFDECAL_LAYER_1);
        :
       /* draw layer geometry using OpenGL Performer or graphics library */
        :
       /* exit decal mode */
       pfDecal(PFDECAL_OFF);

       The different <B>pfDecal</B> modes offer quality-feature trade-
       offs listed in the table below:

       center tab($); C | C | C | C L | L | L | L.  $<B>DISPLACE</B>$-
       <B>STENCIL</B>$<B>(DISPLACE</B> <B>|</B> <B>OFFSET)</B> _ Quality$medium$high$high
       Order$not required$required$not required Coplanarity$not
       required$required$not required Containment$not
       required$required$not required

       The <B>STENCIL</B> mechanism offers the best image quality but at
       a performance cost since the base and layer geometry must
       be rendered in strict order. When multisampling on Reali-
       tyEngine, this mechanism also significantly reduces pixel
       fill performance. An additional constraint is that
       <B>STENCIL</B>ed layers must be coplanar or decal geometry may
       incorrectly show through base geometry. For proper
       results, each layer in the "stack" must be completely con-
       tained within the boundaries of the base geometry.

       The <B>DISPLACE</B> mechanism offers the best performance since
       layers can be sorted by graphics state, because the dis-
       place call itself is usually faster than other mode
       changes, and because there is no pixel fill rate penalty
       when it is in use.

       The <B>DISPLACE</B> mechanism does not require that geometry
       within a single layer be coplanar. The main disadvantage
       is that decal geometry may incorrectly poke through other
       geometry due to the displacement of the decal geometry.

       The performance differences between <B>STENCIL</B> and <B>DISPLACE</B>
       modes are hardware-dependent so some experimentation and
       benchmarking is required to determine the most suitable
       method for your application.

       <B>pfDecal</B> is a display-listable command.  If a pfDispList
       has been opened by <B>pfDispList::open</B>, <B>pfDecal</B> will not have
       immediate effect but will be captured by the pfDispList
       and will only have effect when that pfDispList is later
       drawn with <B>pfDispList::draw</B>.

       <B>pfGetDecal</B> returns the current decal mode.

       The decaling mode state element is identified by the
       <B>PFSTATE_DECAL</B> token.  Use this token with
       <B>pfGeoState::setMode</B> to set the decaling mode of a
       pfGeoState and with <B>pfOverride</B> to override subsequent

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>
       Example 1:

       /* Set up 'base' pfGeoState */
       gstate-&gt;setMode(PFSTATE_DECAL, PFDECAL_BASE);

       /* Attach pfGeoState to pfGeoSet */
       gset-&gt;setGState(gstate);

       /* Draw base pfGeoState */
       gset-&gt;draw();


       Example 2:

       /* Override decaling mode to PFDECAL_OFF */
       pfDecal(PFDECAL_OFF);
       pfOverride(PFSTATE_DECAL, PF_ON);



</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       <B>PFDECAL_BASE_FAST</B> currently implies <B>displacepolygon</B> on
       machines that support this feature.  The use of displace-
       ments for rendering coplanar geometry can cause visual
       artifacts such as decals "Z fighting" or "flimmering" when
       viewed perpendicularly and punching through geometry that
       should be in front of them when viewed obliquely.  In
       these cases, use <B>PFDECAL_LAYER_OFFSET</B>, modify the database
       should by cutting away overlapping polygons to eliminate
       the need for coplanar rendering or use
       <B>PFDECAL_BASE_HIGH_QUALITY</B> or <B>PFDECAL_BASE_STENCIL</B>.

       <B>PFDECAL_BASE_STENCIL</B> is implemented with stencil planes
       and requires the framebuffer to be configured with at
       least one stencil bit (see <B>stensize(3g)</B> and <B>mssize(3g)</B>).
       The first stencil bit should be considered as reserved for
       <B>pfDecal</B>.

       When using <B>PFDECAL_LAYER_OFFSET</B>, the minimum depth buffer
       range set with <B>lsetdepth</B> must be incremented an extra 1024
       * max layers so the negative displacement of the layers
       does not wrap.  <B>pfInitGfx</B> does this automatically.

       The <B>PFDECAL_LAYER_DISPLACE</B> decal mode implements a Z-depth
       bias that is influenced by several issues including near
       clipping plane distance, far clipping plane distance, the
       ratio of these values, and the effective depth precision
       in the Z-buffer. Clipping plane distances can be inquired
       from the pfChannel via channel API and the Z-buffer con-
       figuration of the current pfWindow is available from the
       <B>pfQueryWin</B> function, using the <B>PFQWIN_MIN_DEPTH_VAL</B>,
       <B>PFQWIN_MAX_DEPTH_VAL</B>, and <B>PFQWIN_DEPTH_BITS</B> arguments.
