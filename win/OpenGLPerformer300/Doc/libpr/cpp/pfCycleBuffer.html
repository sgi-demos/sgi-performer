<H2>PARENT CLASS FUNCTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The OpenGL Performer class <B>pfCycleBuffer</B> is  derived  from
       the  parent  class <B>pfObject</B>, so each of these member func-
       tions of class <B>pfObject</B>  are  also  directly  usable  with
       objects  of  class  <B>pfCycleBuffer</B>.   This is also true for
       ancestor classes of class <B>pfObject</B>.

       void*   <B>pfObject::operator</B> <B>new</B>(size_t, void *arena);


       Since the class <B>pfObject</B> is itself derived from the parent
       class <B>pfMemory</B>, objects of class <B>pfCycleBuffer</B> can also be
       used  with  these  functions designed for objects of class
       <B>pfMemory</B>.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Together, pfCycleBuffer and pfCycleMemory provide an auto-
       mated mechanism for managing dynamic data in a  pipelined,
       multiprocessing environment.  In this kind of environment,
       data is typically modified at the head of the pipeline and
       must propagate down it in a "frame-accurate" fashion.  For
       example, assume the coordinates of a pfGeoSet are modified
       for facial animation. If a two-stage rendering pipeline is
       used, then it is likely that the coordinates will be modi-
       fied  in  the  head of the pipeline, at the same time they
       are being rendered in the tail of the pipeline. If only  a
       single  memory  buffer is used, then the pfGeoSet might be
       rendered when its coordinates are only partially  updated,
       potentially  resulting  in  cracks  in  the facial mesh or
       other anomalies.

       A solution to this problem is to use  two  memory  buffers
       for  the  coordinates,  one written to by the head and one
       read from by the tail of the pipeline. In  order  for  the
       new  coordinates  to  propagate  to the rendering stage we
       could copy the newly updated buffer  into  the  renderer's
       buffer  during  a handshake period between the two stages.
       However, if the buffer  is  large,  the  copy  time  could
       become  objectionable.  Another  alternative  is to simply
       swap pointers to the two buffers -  the  classic  "double-
       buffering"  approach.  This  is  much  more  efficient but
       requires that the contents of  the  buffer  be  completely
       updated each frame. Otherwise the render stage will access
       a "stale" buffer that represents the facial expression  at
       a  previous  time  so that the animation will appear to go
       backwards.
       <B>pfCycleBuffer::setCurIndex</B> so that the buffers "cycle". By
       advancing  the index appropriately in each pipeline stage,
       dynamic data can be frame-accurately propagated  down  the
       pipeline.

       While pfCycleBuffers can be used for generic dynamic data,
       a prominent use is as attribute arrays for pfGeoSets.  The
       function  <B>pfGeoSet::setAttr</B>  accepts  pfCycleBuffer memory
       for attribute arrays  and  the  pfGeoSet  will  index  the
       appropriate  pfCycleMemory when rendering and intersection
       testing.  Currently, pfGeoSets  do  not  support  pfCycle-
       Buffer index lists.

       <B>new</B>(arena)  allocates  a  pfCycleBuffer from the specified
       memory arena, or from the process heap if <I>arena</I>  is  NULL.
       <B>new</B>  allocates  a  pfCycleBuffer  from  the default memory
       arena (see <B>pfGetSharedArena</B>).  Like other pfObjects, pfCy-
       cleBuffers  cannot be created statically, automatically on
       the stack or in arrays.  The argument <I>nbytes</I> to  the  con-
       structor  specifies  the  length  of each associated pfCy-
       cleMemory.  pfCycleBuffers should be deleted with <B>pfDelete</B>
       rather than the delete operator.

       The  number  of pfCycleMemorys allocated for each pfCycle-
       Buffer is specified by <B>pfCBufferConfig</B> which is  typically
       called     only     once     at    initialization    time.
       <B>pfGetCBufferConfig</B>   returns    the    number    set    by
       <B>pfCBufferConfig</B>.

       <B>pfCycleBuffer::getClassType</B>  returns  the  <B>pfType</B>* for the
       class   <B>pfCycleBuffer</B>.    The    <B>pfType</B>*    returned    by
       <B>pfCycleBuffer::getClassType</B>  is  the  same  as the <B>pfType</B>*
       returned by invoking the virtual function <B>getType</B>  on  any
       instance of class <B>pfCycleBuffer</B>.  Because OpenGL Performer
       allows subclassing of built-in types, when  decisions  are
       made  based on the type of an object, it is usually better
       to use  the member function <B>isOfType</B> to test if an  object
       is  of a type derived from a Performer type rather than to
       test for strict equality of the <B>pfType</B>*'s.

       <B>pfCycleMemory::getClassType</B> returns the  <B>pfType</B>*  for  the
       class <B>pfCycleMemory</B>.

       <B>pfCycleBuffer::init</B>  initializes  all  pfCycleMemorys of a
       pfCycleBuffer to the data referenced by <I>data</I>. <I>data</I>  should
       be at least of size <I>nbytes</I>.

       pfCycleMemory  is  derived from pfMemory and also provides
       access to its raw data in the  form  of  a  void*  pointer
       through  the  <B>pfMemory::getData</B>  call.  Thus pfCycleBuffer
       memory is arranged in a hierarchy: pfCycleBuffer -&gt;  pfCy-
       cleMemory  -&gt;  void* and various routines exist which con-
       vert one handle into another.  These routines  are  listed
       in the following table.

       tab($)  ;  C  |  C  |  C  |  C  L | L | L | C .  $pfCycle-
       Buffer*$pfCycleMemory*$pfMemory*        _         pfCycle-
       Buffer*$NA$getCMem$getCurData                  pfCycleMem-
       ory*$getCBuffer$NA$getData void*$getCBuffer$getMemory$NA
       current pfCycleMemory = pfCycleBuffer[pfCurCBufferIndex]

       Thus one should always get a new handle to the currently
       active data whenever the global index changes. Data modi-
       fication that is incremental, (such as a += .2) must
       retain a handle to the previous data for proper results
       (current a = previous a + .2).

       As mentioned above, cycling buffer pointers is efficient
       but requires that the buffers be completely updated each
       frame. If the data at some time becomes static, it must
       then be copied into those buffers that are out of date.
       pfCycleBuffer supports this copying automatically with
       <B>pfCycleBuffer::changed</B> in conjunction with
       <B>pfCycleBuffer::frame</B>.  The member function <B>frame</B> advances
       a global frame counter that is used to frame-stamp pfCy-
       cleMemorys.  After the pfCycleBuffer has been updated,
       <B>changed</B> frame-stamps the pfCycleBuffer with the current
       frame count.  Then if that pfCycleBuffer is not changed in
       a later frame, the member function <B>frame</B> will automati-
       cally copy the latest pfCycleMemory into its currently
       active, sibling pfCycleMemory. This copying will continue
       until all selected pfCycleMemorys contain the latest data.
       To determine the frame stamp of a pfCycleMemory, use the
       member function <B>getFrame</B>. <B>pfCycleBuffer::getFrameCount</B>
       returns the current, global, pfCycleBuffer frame count.


       The following are examples of pfCycleBuffer usage for
       <B>libpr</B>-only and <B>libpf</B> applications. When using <B>libpf</B>,
       <B>pfConfig</B> and <B>pfFrame</B> call <B>pfCycleBuffer::config</B> and
       <B>pfCycleBuffer::frame</B> respectively so the application
       should not call the latter routines.  In addition, <B>libpf</B>
       calls <B>pfCurCBufferIndex</B> in each process so that pfCycle-
       Buffer changes are properly propagated down the processing
       pipelines.

       Example 1: <B>libpr</B>-only pfCycleBuffer example


       pfVec3         *prevVerts, *curVerts;

       /*
        * Configure number of pfCycleMemorys per pfCycleBuffer
       */
       numBuffers-&gt;config();

       verts = new pfCycleBuffer(sizeof(pfVec3) * numVerts);
       gset-&gt;setAttr(PFGS_COORD3, PFGS_PER_VERTEX, verts, NULL);

       while(!done)
       {
           static int index = 0;

           index-&gt;setCurIndex();

           curVerts = verts-&gt;getCurData();

           /* Compute new positions of mass-spring system */

           /* Advance cyclebuffer frame count */
           pfCycleBuffer::frame();

           /* Advance buffer index. */
           index = (index + 1) % numBuffers;
       }



       Example 2: <B>libpf</B> pfCycleBuffer example


       pfVec3         *prevVerts, *curVerts;

       pfInit();

       pfMultiprocess(mpMode);

       /*
        * This calls pfCycleBuffer::config() with the number of buffers
        * appropriate to the multiprocessing mode.
       */
       pfConfig();

       verts = new(pfGetSharedArena()) pfCycleBuffer(sizeof(pfVec3) * numVerts);
       gset-&gt;setAttr(PFGS_COORD3, PFGS_PER_VERTEX, verts, NULL);

       while(!done)
       {
           curVerts = verts-&gt;getCurData();

           /* Compute new positions of mass-spring system */
           for (i=0; i&lt;numVerts; i++)
            curVerts[i] = prevVerts[i] + netForceVector * deltaTime;

           /* Indicate that 'verts' has changed */
           verts-&gt;changed();

           prevVerts = curVerts;

           /* This calls pfCycleBuffer::frame() */
           pfFrame();
       }

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       The global index which selects the currently active pfCy-
       cleMemory is unique for a given address space. Specifi-
       cally, share group processes like those spawned by <B>sproc</B>
       will share the same global index.
