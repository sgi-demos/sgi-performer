<H2>PARENT CLASS FUNCTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The OpenGL Performer class <B>pfFile</B> is derived from the par-
       ent class <B>pfObject</B>, so each of these member  functions  of
       class  <B>pfObject</B>  are  also directly usable with objects of
       class <B>pfFile</B>.  This is also true for ancestor  classes  of
       class <B>pfObject</B>.

       void*   <B>pfObject::operator</B> <B>new</B>(size_t);
       void*   <B>pfObject::operator</B> <B>new</B>(size_t, void *arena);
       void*   <B>pfObject::operator</B>      <B>new</B>(size_t,     pfFluxMem-
                 ory *fmem);
       void    <B>pfObject::setUserData</B>(void *data);
       void    <B>pfObject::setUserData</B>(int slot, void *data);
       void*   <B>pfObject::getUserData</B>(pfObject *obj);
       void*   <B>pfObject::getUserData</B>(pfObject *obj, int slot);
       int     <B>pfObject::getNumUserData</B>();


       Since the class <B>pfObject</B> is itself derived from the parent
       class  <B>pfMemory</B>,  objects of class <B>pfFile</B> can also be used
       with  these  functions  designed  for  objects  of   class
       <B>pfMemory</B>.

       void*          <B>pfMemory::getData</B>(const void *ptr);
       pfType *       <B>pfMemory::getType</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::isOfType</B>(pfType *type);
       int            <B>pfMemory::isExactType</B>(pfType *type);
       const char *   <B>pfMemory::getTypeName</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::copy</B>(pfMemory *src);
       int            <B>pfMemory::compare</B>(const pfMemory *mem);
       void           <B>pfMemory::print</B>(uint which,   uint verbose,
                        char *prefix, FILE *file);

       int            <B>pfMemory::checkDelete</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::isFluxed</B>();
       void *         <B>pfMemory::getArena</B>();
       int            <B>pfMemory::getSize</B>();

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <B>pfFile</B> member functions  <B>create,</B>  <B>open,</B>  <B>close,</B>  <B>read,</B>
       <B>write,</B>  and  <B>seek</B> operate in an identical fashion and take
       similar arguments as the standard UNIX file I/O functions:
       <B>creat,</B>  <B>open,</B>  <B>close,</B> <B>read,</B> <B>write,</B> and <B>lseek</B>.  The differ-
       ence is that  they  return  immediately  without  blocking
       while  the physical file-system access operation completes
       and also that instead of an  integer  file  descriptor,  a
       pfFile  handle is used.  OpenGL Performer supports a maxi-
       mum of <B>PFRTF_MAXREQ</B> pending file I/O requests.

       When called, <B>pfFile::open</B> and <B>pfFile::create</B> create a  new
       process  using  the  <B>sproc</B> mechanism that manages the file
       operations asynchronously with the  calling  process.   If
       the  calling  process  has  super-user privileges, the new
       process will assign itself to processor 0, and  lower  its
       priority.   The  spawned process will exit when either its
       pfFile is closed via <B>pfFile::close</B> or when its parent pro-
       cess  (that  which called the member function <B>pfFile::open</B>
       or <B>pfFile::create</B>) exits.  The pfFile structure is created
       on the process heap.

       <B>pfFile::close</B>  closes the open file and terminates the I/O
       process created by <B>pfFile::open</B> or  <B>pfFile::close</B>.   <B>close</B>
       does not free <I>file</I> - use <B>pfDelete</B> for that purpose.

       <B>pfFile::getClassType</B>  returns  the  <B>pfType</B>*  for the class
       <B>pfFile</B>.  The <B>pfType</B>* returned by <B>pfGetFileClassType</B> is the
       same  as the <B>pfType</B>* returned by invoking the member func-
       tion <B>getType</B> on any instance  of  class  <B>pfFile</B>.   Because
       OpenGL  Performer  allows  subclassing  of built-in types,
       when decisions are made based on the type of an object, it
       is  usually  better to use the member function <B>isOfType</B> to
       test if an object is of a type derived  from  a  Performer
       type  rather  than  to  test  for  strict  equality of the
       <B>pfType</B>*'s.

       <B>pfFile::getStatus</B> returns the status of <I>file</I> corresponding
       to <B>attr</B> which may be one of:

              <B>PFRTF_STATUS</B>        Return  0  if  last action com-
                                  plete  and  no  other   actions
                                  pending.    1   if   action  in
                                  progress, and -1 if last action
                                  failed.

              <B>PFRTF_CMD</B>           Return  the  current  (or last)
                                  file I/O  action,  one  of  the
                                  following:
                                  <B>PFRTF_NOACTION</B>
                                  <B>PFRTF_CREATE</B>
                                  <B>PFRTF_OPEN</B>
                                  <B>PFRTF_READ</B>
                                  <B>PFRTF_WRITE</B>

              <B>PFRTF_OFFSET</B>        Return the offset from the last
                                  seek action.

              <B>PFRTF_PID</B>           Return the process  id  of  the
                                  I/O   process  associated  with
                                  <I>file</I>.

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       OpenGL Performer for  Linux  does  not  currently  support
       Direct File I/O.

       The  need  for the pfFile facility has been largely super-
       seded by the IRIX  5  asynchronous  I/O  facility.   These
       capabilities are accessible through <B>aio_cancel</B>, <B>aio_error</B>,
       <B>aio_init</B>,   <B>aio_read</B>,   <B>aio_return</B>,    <B>aio_suspend</B>,    and
       <B>aio_write</B>.   Users are encouraged to use the aio functions
       for performing asynchronous file  operations  in  programs
       now in development.

       The  calling  process  should always call <B>pfFile::close</B> to
       close a file before exiting.  If the calling program exits
       without doing so, the file will not be closed.  Such files
       can be challenging to remove from the file system.
