<H2>PARENT CLASS FUNCTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The OpenGL Performer class <B>pfGeoState</B> is derived from the
       parent class <B>pfObject</B>, so each of these member functions
       of class <B>pfObject</B> are also directly usable with objects of
       class <B>pfGeoState</B>.  This is also true for ancestor classes
       of class <B>pfObject</B>.

       void*   <B>pfObject::operator</B> <B>new</B>(size_t);
       void*   <B>pfObject::operator</B> <B>new</B>(size_t, void *arena);

                 ory *fmem);

       Since the class <B>pfObject</B> is itself derived from the parent
       class <B>pfMemory</B>, objects of class <B>pfGeoState</B> can also be
       used with these functions designed for objects of class

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A pfGeoState is an encapsulation of libpr graphics modes
       and attributes (see <B>pfState</B>).  For example, a pfGeoState
       can describe a glass surface by referencing a shiny pfMa-
       terial and enabling transparency.  When a pfGeoState is
       applied by <B>pfGeoState::apply</B> it sets up the graphics state
       through normal libpr routines such as <B>pfMaterial::apply</B>
       and <B>pfTransparency</B>.

       Most pieces of state that may be manipulated through libpr
       immediate mode routines may be specified on a per-
       pfGeoState basis.  For customized state management,
       pfGeoStates provide function callbacks.  In addition,
       pfGeoStates can be indexed through a global table so a
       single database can have multiple appearances while avoid-
       ing database duplication.

       The primary use of a pfGeoState is to attach it to a
       pfGeoSet (<B>pfGeoSet::setGState</B>) in order to define the
       appearance of the geometry encapsulated by the pfGeoSet.
       As discussed below, pfGeoStates have the useful property
       of order-independence so that paired pfGeoSets and
       pfGeoStates will be rendered consistently regardless of
       order.

       pfGeoState state may either be locally set or globally
       inherited.  By default, if a state element is not speci-
       fied on a pfGeoState, then that pfGeoState will inherit
       that state element from the global state.  Global state is
       set through libpr immediate mode functions, e.g.,
       <B>pfMaterial::apply</B>, <B>pfTransparency</B>, <B>pfDecal</B>, <B>pfFog::apply</B>
       or through <B>pfGeoState::load</B> as described below. Local
       state is set on a pfGeoState through <B>pfGeoState::setMode</B>,
       <B>pfGeoState::setAttr</B>, or <B>pfGeoState::setVal</B>.

       If all state elements are locally set, then a pfGeoState
       becomes a full graphics context since all state is defined
       at the pfGeoState level.  While this is useful, it usually
       makes sense to inherit most state from global default val-
       ues and explicitly set only those state elements which are
       expected to change often.  Examples of useful global
       defaults are lighting model (<B>pfLightModel</B>), lights (-
       <B>pfLight</B>), fog (<B>pfFog</B>), and transparency (<B>pfTransparency</B>,
       you need not consider the problem of one pfGeoState cor-
       rupting another by state inheritance through the underly-
       ing graphics library. The actual pfGeoState pop is a lazy
       one and does not happen unless a subsequent pfGeoState
       needs the default state restored.  This means that the
       actual state between pfGeoStates is not necessarily the
       global state.  If a return to global state is required,
       call <B>pfFlushState</B> which will restore the global state.

       It is a performance advantage to locally set as little
       local pfGeoState state as possible.  This may be accom-
       plished by setting global defaults which satisfy the
       majority of pfGeoStates being drawn.  For example, if most
       of your database is textured, you should enable texturing
       at initialization time (<B>pfEnable</B>(<B>PFEN_TEXTURE</B>)) and con-
       figure your pfGeoStates to inherit the texture enable
       mode.

       <B>new</B>(arena) allocates a pfGeoState from the specified mem-
       ory arena, or from the process heap if <I>arena</I> is NULL.  <B>new</B>
       allocates a pfGeoState from the default memory arena (see
       <B>pfGetSharedArena</B>).  Like other pfObjects, pfGeoStates can-
       not be created statically, automatically on the stack or
       in arrays.  pfGeoStates should be deleted with <B>pfDelete</B>
       rather than the delete operator.  All modes and attributes
       are inherited by default.

       <B>pfGeoState::getClassType</B> returns the <B>pfType</B>* for the class
       <B>pfGeoState</B>.  The <B>pfType</B>* returned by
       <B>pfGeoState::getClassType</B> is the same as the <B>pfType</B>*
       returned by invoking the virtual function <B>getType</B> on any
       instance of class <B>pfGeoState</B>.  Because OpenGL Performer
       allows subclassing of built-in types, when decisions are
       made based on the type of an object, it is usually better
       to use  the member function <B>isOfType</B> to test if an object
       is of a type derived from a Performer type rather than to
       test for strict equality of the <B>pfType</B>*'s.

       <B>pfGeoState::setMode</B> sets <I>mode</I> to <I>val</I>.  <I>mode</I> is a symbolic
       constant specifying the mode to set.  Once set, a mode is
       no longer inherited but is set to <I>val</I>.  <I>mode</I> is a symbolic
       token and is one of:

              <B>PFSTATE_TRANSPARENCY</B>
              <B>PFSTATE_ANTIALIAS</B>
              <B>PFSTATE_DECAL</B>
              <B>PFSTATE_ALPHAFUNC</B>
              <B>PFSTATE_ENLIGHTING</B>
              <B>PFSTATE_ENTEXTURE</B>
              <B>PFSTATE_ENFOG</B>
              <B>PFSTATE_CULLFACE</B>
              <B>PFSTATE_ENWIREFRAME</B>
              <B>PFSTATE_ENCOLORTABLE</B>
              <B>PFSTATE_ENHIGHLIGHTING</B>
              <B>PFSTATE_ENLPOINTSTATE</B>
              <B>PFSTATE_ENTEXGEN</B>
              <B>PFSTATE_ENTEXLOD</B>
              <B>PFSTATE_ENTEXMAT</B>


       <B>pfGeoState::setVal</B> sets the <I>gsval</I> value to <I>val</I>.  <I>gsval</I> is
       a symbolic constant specifying the state value to set.
       Once set, a value is no longer inherited but is set to
       <I>val</I>.  <I>gsval</I> is a symbolic token and can be chosen from any
       of the following list (only one choice at present):
              <B>PFSTATE_ALPHAREF</B>

       <B>pfGeoState::setAttr</B> sets <I>attr</I> state element to <I>a</I>.  <I>attr</I> is
       a symbolic constant starting with <B>PFSTATE_</B> specifying an
       attribute and is combined with <I>data</I>, a handle to an
       attribute structure of the appropriate <B>libpr</B> object rele-
       vant to <B>attr</B>.


              <B>PFSTATE_FRONTMTL</B>         pfMaterial*

              <B>PFSTATE_BACKMTL</B>          pfMaterial*

              <B>PFSTATE_TEXTURE</B>          pfTexture*

              <B>PFSTATE_FOG</B>              pfFog*

              <B>PFSTATE_LIGHTMODEL</B>       pfLightModel*

              <B>PFSTATE_LIGHTS</B>           pfLight**

              <B>PFSTATE_COLORTABLE</B>       pfColortable*

              <B>PFSTATE_HIGHLIGHT</B>        pfHighlight*

              <B>PFSTATE_LPOINTSTATE</B>      pfLPointState*

              <B>PFSTATE_TEXGEN</B>           pfTexGen*

              <B>PFSTATE_TEXLOD</B>           pfTexLOD*

              <B>PFSTATE_TEXMAT</B>           pfMatrix*

              <B>PFSTATE_DECALPLANE</B>       pfPlane*

       If <I>attr</I> is <B>PFSTATE_LIGHTS</B>, <I>a</I> should be an array of
       pfLight* of length <B>PF_MAX_LIGHTS</B> which specifies which
       pfLights should be used by the pfGeoState.  Empty entries
       in the light array should be <B>NULL</B>.

       A pfGeoState ignores the <B>PFMTL_FRONT</B> and <B>PFMTL_BACK</B> set-
       ting of a pfMaterial (see <B>pfMaterial::setSide</B>).  Instead
       it uses the attribute value, <B>PFSTATE_FRONTMTL</B> or
       <B>PFSTATE_BACKMTL</B> to decide how to apply the material.  Con-
       sequently, it is legal to use the same material for both
       front and back sides.  However, pfGeoStates do not modify
       the pfMaterial's side value which is normally set through
       <B>pfMaterial::setSide</B>.

       Once set, an attribute is no longer inherited but set to
       <I>a</I>.  Only attributes which differ from the global state
       <B>pfGeoState::setAttr</B> will <I>not</I> delete any pfObject whose
       reference count reaches 0.

       <B>pfGeoState</B> supports a few multi-valued elements. At pre-
       sent, all these multi-valued elements are related to the
       multi-texture OpenGL extension.  The multi-texture exten-
       sion enables the application of multiple texture maps on a
       single polygon in a single drawing pass. This extension
       uses multiple texture environments to determine the blend-
       ing among the texture units.  All <B>pfGeoState</B> methods that
       set/get attributes and modes have multi-valued versions.
       The multi-valued versions take one additional parameter:
       <I>index</I>. In the case of the multi-texture extension, this
       variable picks the hardware texture unit that an attribute
       or a value refer to.

       <B>pfGeoState::setMultiAttr</B> is a version of
       <B>pfGeoState::setAttr</B> used for setting multi-valued
       attributes. A multi-values attribute collapses a set of
       attributes into a single <B>pfGeoState</B> attribute. <I>index</I> picks
       the texture unit that <I>attr</I> will be applied to. The follow-
       ing attribute tokens have multiple values:

              <B>PFSTATE_TEXTURE</B>
              <B>PFSTATE_TEXENV</B>
              <B>PFSTATE_TEXGEN</B>
              <B>PFSTATE_TEXLOD</B>
              <B>PFSTATE_TEXMAT</B>

       Similarly, <B>pfGeoState::getMultiAttr</B>,
       <B>pfGeoState::getCurMultiAttr</B> and
       <B>pfGeoState::getCombinedMultiAttr</B> are multi-valued versions
       of <B>pfGeoState::getAttr</B>, <B>pfGeoState::getCurAttr</B> and
       <B>pfGeoState::getCombinedAttr</B>. All accept the above multi-
       value attribute tokens.

       <B>pfGeoState::setMultiMode</B> is a multi-value version of
       <B>pfGeoState::setMode</B>. It sets the <I>index</I>-th element of <I>mode</I>
       to <I>val</I>.  It accepts the following multi-value mode tokens:

              <B>PFSTATE_ENTEXTURE</B>
              <B>PFSTATE_ENTEXGEN</B>
              <B>PFSTATE_ENTEXLOD</B>
              <B>PFSTATE_ENTEXMAT</B>

       Similarly, <B>pfGeoState::getMultiMode</B>,
       <B>pfGeoState::getCurMultiMode</B>  and
       <B>pfGeoState::getCombinedMultiMode</B> are multi-value versions
       of <B>pfGeoState::getMode</B>, <B>pfGeoState::getCurMode</B>  and
       <B>pfGeoState::getCombinedMode</B>.  All accept the above multi-
       value mode tokens.

       When (<I>mode</I> == <B>PFSTATE_ENTEXTURE</B>) <B>pfGeoState</B> expects a con-
       tiguous sequence of enable values. The first disabled
       index in this mode determines how many values <B>pfGeoState</B>
       recognizes. For example, when calling
       <B>gstate-&gt;setMultiMode(PFSTATE_ENTEXTURE,</B> <B>index,</B> <B>1)</B> for
       index=[0, 1, 3], <B>pfGeoState</B> will process two texture units
       and will ignore the (<I>index</I> == 3) case.  In addition, if
       equivalent to calling the single-value version of the
       method.

       As discussed above, modes, values and attributes may
       either be locally set on a pfGeoState or inherited from
       the global state. To help resolve the inheritance charac-
       teristics of pfGeoStates, 3 different versions of "get"
       routines are provided for modes, values and attributes:

              1.     <B>pfGeoState::getMode</B>, <B>pfGeoState::getVal</B>,
                     <B>pfGeoState::getAttr</B> - The exact mode, value,
                     or attribute of the pfGeoState is returned.

              2.     <B>pfGeoState::getCurMode</B>,
                     <B>pfGeoState::getCurVal</B>,
                     <B>pfGeoState::getCurAttr</B> - The exact mode,
                     value, or attribute of the pfGeoState is
                     returned if not inherited. Otherwise the
                     mode, value, or attribute of the currently
                     active global pfGeoState is returned. Note
                     that this requires that a pfState be current
                     (see <B>pfState::select</B>).

              3.     <B>pfGeoState::getCombinedMode</B>,
                     <B>pfGeoState::getCombinedVal</B>,
                     <B>pfGeoState::getCombinedAttr</B> - The exact
                     mode, value, or attribute of the pfGeoState
                     is returned if not inherited. Otherwise the
                     mode, value, or attribute of the <I>combGState</I>
                     is returned.

       <B>pfGeoState::getMode</B> returns the mode value corresponding
       to <I>mode</I>.

       <B>pfGeoState::getVal</B> returns the pfGeoState value corre-
       sponding to <I>gsval</I>.

       <B>pfGeoState::getAttr</B> returns the attribute handle corre-
       sponding to <I>attr</I>. If <I>attr</I> is <B>PFSTATE_LIGHTS</B>, the returned
       value is the pfLight* array.

       <B>pfGeoState::setInherit</B> specifies which state elements
       should be inherited from the global state.  <I>mask</I> is a bit-
       wise OR of tokens listed for <B>pfGeoState::setMode</B>,
       <B>pfGeoState::setAttr</B>, and <B>pfGeoState::setVal</B>.  All of the
       state elements specified in <I>mask</I> will become inherited.
       All modes and attributes are inherited unless explicitly
       specified by setting a mode or attribute with
       <B>pfGeoState::setAttr</B>, <B>pfGeoState::setMode</B>, or
       <B>pfGeoState::setVal</B>.  <B>pfGeoState::getInherit</B> returns the
       bitwise OR of the tokens for state which is currently
       inherited from the global state.

       <B>pfGeoState::apply</B> makes the pfGeoState the current graph-
       ics state.  All modes and attributes of the pfGeoState
       that are not inherited are applied using libpr immediate
       mode commands, for example, the <B>PFSTATE_TEXTURE</B> attribute
       is applied with <B>pfTexture::apply</B>.  Inherited modes and
       attributes that were modified by previous pfGeoStates are
       <B>pfGeoState::apply</B> with the attached pfGeoState so that
       graphics state is properly established before the pfGeoSet
       geometry is rendered.

       The following is an example of pfGeoState behavior.

       Example 1:

       /* Configure global default that pfGeoStates can inherit */
       pfLightModel *lmodel = new pfLightModel;
       pfLight *light = new pfLight;
       pfEnable(PFEN_LIGHTING);
       lmodel-&gt;apply();
       light-&gt;on();
       pfTransparency(PFTR_OFF);

       /* New pfGeoState inherits everything */
       gstate = new pfGeoState;

       /* Attach 'gstate' to 'gset' */
       gset-&gt;setGState(gstate);

       /* Configure 'gstate' with a transparent material */
       gstate-&gt;setAttr(PFSTATE_FRONTMTL, mtl);
       gstate-&gt;setMode(PFSTATE_TRANSPARENCY, PFTR_ON);


       Method A:

       /* Draw transparent 'gset' */
       gset-&gt;draw();


       Method B:

       /* Remove 'gstate' from 'gset' */
       gset-&gt;setGState(NULL);

       /* Apply 'gstate' */
       gstate-&gt;apply();

       /* Draw transparent 'gset' */
       gset-&gt;draw();


       Method C:

       /* Remove 'gstate' from 'gset' */
       gset-&gt;setGState(NULL);

       mtl-&gt;apply();
       pfTransparency(PFTR_ON);

       /* Draw transparent 'gset' */
       gset-&gt;draw();


       In the above example, methods A, B, and C are all produce
       the same visual result. Method A is recommended, however,
       pfLightModel *lmodel = new pfLightModel;
       pfLight *light = new pfLight;
       /* Configure global default that pfGeoStates can inherit */
       pfEnable(PFEN_LIGHTING);

       lmodel-&gt;apply();
       light-&gt;on();

       /* Assume 'redMtl' is PFMTL_FRONT */
       redMtl-&gt;apply();

       /* New pfGeoStates inherit everything */
       gstateA = new pfGeoState;
       gstateB = new pfGeoState;

       /* Attach pfGeoStates to pfGeoSets */
       gsetA-&gt;setGState(gstateA);
       gsetB-&gt;setGState(gstateB);

       /* Configure 'gstateA' with a green material */
       gstateA-&gt;setAttr(PFSTATE_FRONTMTL, greenMtl);

       /* Draw green 'gset' */
       gsetA-&gt;draw();

       /*
        * The FRONTMTL property of gstateB is not set so it inherits
        * the global default of 'redMtl' which will be restored
        * as the current pfMaterial when gstateB is applied.
        */

       /* Draw red 'gset' */
       gsetB-&gt;draw();

       /*
        * Note that gsetA and gsetB could be drawn in the opposite
        * order with the same results.  This is a very important
        * pfGeoState property.
        */


       <B>pfGetCurGState</B> returns the current pfGeoState that was
       previously applied directly by <B>pfGeoState::apply</B> or indi-
       rectly by <B>pfGeoSet::draw</B>.

       <B>pfGeoState::setFuncs</B> sets the callbacks and callback data
       pointer of the pfGeoState. The reference count of <I>data</I> is
       incremented and the reference count of the previous data
       is decremented but no deletion takes place if the refer-
       ence count reaches 0. Callbacks are invoked by
       <B>pfGeoState::apply</B> (or indirectly by <B>pfGeoSet::draw</B> as
       described above) in the following order:


       <I>postFunc</I>() of previously-applied pfGeoState
       setup state according to current pfGeoState
       <I>preFunc</I>() of current pfGeoState


       by the pfGeoState. Consequently, the global state is not
       modified and the normal pfGeoState inheritance rules apply
       to state set inside the callbacks.

       Callbacks are passed a pointer to the parent pfGeoState
       and the <I>data</I> pointer that was previously supplied by
       <B>pfGeoState::setFuncs</B>.  The return value from pfGeoState
       callbacks is currently ignored.  <B>pfGeoState::getFuncs</B> gets
       back the pre and post pfGeoState callbacks and callback
       data for the pfGeoState in <I>preFunc</I>, <I>postFunc</I>, and <I>data</I>,
       respectively.

       A pfGeoSet may either directly reference or indirectly
       index a pfGeoState with <B>pfGeoSet::setGState</B> and
       <B>pfGeoSet::setGStateIndex</B> respectively.  Indexed
       pfGeoStates use a global table of pfGeoState pointers that
       is set by <B>pfGeoState::applyTable</B>. If the global table is
       <B>NULL</B> or the pfGeoState index is out of the range of the
       global table, no pfGeoState is applied, otherwise the
       indexed pfGeoState is applied when <B>pfGeoSet::draw</B> is
       called. Non-indexed pfGeoState references ignore the cur-
       rent pfGeoState table. <B>pfGetCurGStateTable</B> returns the
       current pfGeoState table and <B>pfGetCurIndexedGState</B> returns
       the <I>index</I>th pfGeoState* in the current pfGeoState table or
       <B>NULL</B> if the index cannot be properly resolved.

       <B>pfGeoState::load</B> is similar to <B>pfGeoState::apply</B> except
       the modes and attributes of the pfGeoState can be inher-
       ited by subsequent pfGeoStates.  In other words, the
       pfGeoState loads the global state.  Overridden state ele-
       ments are not modified by <B>pfGeoState::load</B>. If set, the
       pre-callback of the pfGeoState is invoked after the graph-
       ics state is loaded. As described above, the post-callback
       is not invoked until a subsequent pfGeoState is applied or
       <B>pfPushState</B>, <B>pfPopState</B>, or <B>pfFlushState</B> is called.

       <B>pfGeoState::apply</B>, <B>pfGeoState::applyTable</B>, and
       <B>pfGeoState::load</B> are display-listable commands.  If a
       pfDispList has been opened by <B>pfDispList::open</B>, these com-
       mands will not have immediate effect but will be captured
       by the pfDispList and will only have effect when that
       pfDispList is later executed with <B>pfDispList::draw</B>.
       Indexed pfGeoStates are resolved at display list creation
       time, not at display list execution time. In addition,
       pfGeoStates are "unwound" into their constituent parts at
       display list creation time, e.g., a pfGeoState may decom-
       pose into <B>pfMaterial::apply</B> and <B>pfTransparency</B> calls. As a
       result, changes to a pfGeoState which have been captured
       by a pfDispList will *not* be evident when that pfDispList
       is executed (<B>pfDispList::draw</B>). pfGeoState indexing and
       unwinding at display list creation time is done strictly
       to improve pfDispList rendering performance.

       <B>pfGeoState::makeBasic</B> configures every state element
       (value, mode, and attribute) of the pfGeoState to be iden-
       tical to the state set with <B>pfBasicState</B>.  The "basic"
       state is the initial state of a graphics library window -
       everything is "off". For example, the PFSTATE_ENLIGHTING
       mode will be set to PF_OFF, and the PFSTATE_CULLFACE mode

<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       In some situations it may appear that pfGeoStates do
       inherit from each other.  This is because OpenGL Performer
       currently does not provide any defaults for the state
       attributes listed above such as <B>PFSTATE_TEXTURE</B> and
       <B>PFSTATE_FRONTMTL</B>.  Consequently, if the application does
       not explicitly set these attributes, it is possible for
       pfGeoStates which inherit these attributes to inherit them
       from previous pfGeoStates.
