<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       These functions provide a mechanism for using OpenGL
       Shader objects within Performer. As of Performer 3.0,
       OpenGL Shader objects can be used natively in Performer
       applications with very little API duplication on the Per-
       former side. To this end, the shader support introduced in
       Performer 2.4 has been removed from this and future
       releases.

       OpenGL Shader encapsulates the description of the appear-
       ance of an object in the islAppearance class. Performer
       islAppearances coming into view.

       OpenGL Shader integration is not completely transparent,
       however, since Performer must use its own callbacks as
       hooks into the OpenGL Shader library. Since any user spec-
       ified callbacks are lost and users have no access to Per-
       former's islShape and islDrawAction classes, Performer
       provides a set of its own callbacks that can be used in
       place of OpenGL Shader's.

       <B>pfShaderTexCoordFunc</B> is used to register a texture coordi-
       nate generation callback. When rendering objects with an
       islDrawAction, OpenGL Shader asks for geometry to be drawn
       with a specified texture coordinate identification code.
       These codes are user defined, so Performer must pass the
       task of generating the corresponding texture coordinates
       to the user. The <B>appearance</B> parameter specifies which
       islAppearance the callbacks applies to. The <B>func</B> parameter
       is a pointer to the user callback and the <B>udata</B> parameter
       is a user data pass through pointer. The user callback
       must be of type <B>pfTexCoordCallbackType</B>. If <I>appearance</I> is
       NULL, all currently registered islAppearances will be
       updated to use the specified callback and user data.


       In the texture coordinate callback function, the
       <B>pfISLTexCoordData</B> pointer refers to a class which contains
       useful information for computing the requested texture
       coordinates, such as the pfGeoSet being rendered, its
       islAppearance and the pfGeoSet's modelview matrix.  The
       <B>texCoordID</B> parameter is the pass-through texture coordi-
       nate identification from an islShader and the <B>userData</B>
       parameter points to the user data specified when register-
       ing the callback.

       The user callback must return a set of Performer texture
       coordinates for rendering the specified pfGeoSet.

       <B>pfShaderTexApplyFunc</B> is used to register a texture appli-
       cation callback. This callback is invoked whenever OpenGL
       Shader asks for a specific named texture to be applied.
       The callback function is passed the islAppearance that
       requested the texture bind, the texture name, and any user
       data specified when the callback is registered. The return
       value from the user callback is the number of dimensions
       in the texture; 1, 2 or 3. If <I>appearance</I> is NULL, all cur-
       rently registered islAppearances will be updated to use
       the specified callback and user data.

       By default, Performer registers the
       <B>pfDefaultTextureApplyCallback</B> function with each islAp-
       pearance that is installed on a pfGeoSet. This default
       callback is a useful utility that assumes that the texture
       name is the name of a file and it tries to load that file
       from disk and applies it.

       <B>pfShaderTexComputeFunc</B> is used to register a texture com-
       putation callback. Often, it is necessary to use procedu-
       ral textures for shading and and it is most efficient to
       modelview matrix.  If <I>appearance</I> is NULL, all currently
       registered islAppearances will be updated to use the spec-
       ified callback and user data.

       By default, Performer registers the
       <B>pfDefaultTextureComputeCallback</B> with each islAppearance
       that is added to a pfGeoSet. This default callback loads
       the specified texture and stores it in a global lookup
       table. When the pfDefaultTextureApplyCallback is invoked
       as described above, it applies a texture from this lookup
       table.

       <B>pfShaderChanged</B> should be called whenever any shader
       parameters of any islShader have been modified. The
       <I>appearance</I> parameter specifies which islAppearance con-
       tains the shader that has changed and the <I>shader</I> parameter
       specifies specifically which shader has been changed.

       <B>pfAppearanceChanged</B> should be called whenever an islAp-
       pearance that Performer references has been changed by
       adding or removing a shader.
